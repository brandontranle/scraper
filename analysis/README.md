# Data Analysis: Keyword Search in Scraped Data
This document outlines the keyword search and data analysis process applied to the files outputted by the Reddit and SideQuestVR scrapers. The goal of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights related to Security and Privacy (S&P) topics from the scraped content.

## Overview

After scraping data from Reddit and SideQuestVR, the data files are processed to perform keyword searches. This process helps to identify key trends, topics, and user concerns related to security and privacy within the VR and Android ecosystems. The data analysis primarily focuses on finding patterns in user discussions and reviews by searching for specific keywords.

### Steps Involved
1. **Load Data**: The `.txt` or `.csv` files generated by the scrapers are loaded into the analysis tool using Python.
   
2. **Keyword Definition**: A predefined list of security and privacy-related keywords (e.g., "privacy", "data collection", "security", "vulnerability", etc.) is created for the search. These keywords are chosen based on the expected topics of interest within the VR and Android S&P domains.

3. **Search Process**: The analysis tool scans through each post, comment, or review and searches for the occurrence of the predefined keywords. 

4. **Results**: The results include the frequency of keyword occurences.

### Why?
The results extracted from the outputted data files of the scraper are inserted into OpenAI's GPT-4o along with the results of the keyword search results to provide contextual depth or analysis on why the words were mentioned in the first place.
In other words, key patterns and conversations are being summarized based on the frequency of the keywords.
