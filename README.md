# Starter Task: S&P Web Crawlers


### Introduction
This repository contains web crawlers designed to collect and analyze security and privacy (S&P) data from Reddit and SideQuestVR. The crawlers are built to scrape content such as user reviews, forum posts, and discussions, specifically focusing on topics related to Security and Privacy (S&P) in VR and Android systems. In my experiment, I scraped roughly 220 Reddit posts, where 110 were focused on VR S&P and the other 110 were focused on Android S&P, accumulating 86,000 bodies of text contained within posts, comments, and replies. Furthermore, I scraped over reviews of over 200 applications listed on the most popular section of SideQuestVR's website, gathering over 32,600 reviews.  

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to identify and analyze patterns and trends related to security and privacy concerns within VR and Android ecosystems. By scraping and analyzing large datasets from these platforms, the goal is to uncover recurring themes in user discussions, reviews, and experiences regarding data privacy, security vulnerabilities, and user protection.

Additionally, the crawlers aim to explore how privacy concerns or digital literacy differ between VR platforms and Android systems. The results will help highlight potential security gaps and provide insights into how users perceive the importance of privacy across different platforms.

### Reports
These two reports focus on the data analysis and development of the web crawlers.
