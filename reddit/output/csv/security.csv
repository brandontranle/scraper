"Passed OSCP+ on first attempt! (70/110pts)","twixter07","oscp","74","1731035736.0","14","https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/1gm90h3/passed_oscp_on_first_attempt_70110pts/","This was the wildest roller coaster of a test I‚Äôve ever taken. I just got the email that I passed today. It took about 44 hours to hear back after submitting the report whether I passed or not. Someone on here said to check the ‚Äúexam‚Äù tab in your PEN-200 dashboard because they show if you pass there sooner than they email and this was actually true for me. I purchased the learn one year subscription about 11 months ago and honestly, I did not lock in my studying until about 3 months before. This was a mistake as I could have gotten a lot more practice and been more prepared. For labs I ended up only doing OSCP A B C (some hints were needed) and Secura, and like 3 PG machines. This was also likely a mistake. I did not do a practice report for OSCP A B C or treat them like mock exams. I just used the OffSec template for the real report. I had some experience with pen testing knowledge and tools from my GPEN certification and some very inconsistent HTB usage a long time ago. I‚Äôve also watched a TON of ippsec videos. I think this alone is why I was able to get away with such little lab practice. I had a pretty solid baseline which helped a lot. Most of the PEN-200 material I was already familiar with, and I only ended up completing 50% of the course. Thats not to say it was not valuable however. This is my first OSCP attempt so I don‚Äôt know about the old AD, but this new AD with partial points was my life saver. I would not have passed without this change. Here‚Äôs a rough timeline of my experience: 4PM: Started the exam, got my VPN files and dashboard and such. I had some trouble figuring out how to share both my screens with the proctor so in reality I probably started at like 4:15PM. Make sure you log in 15 minutes early at least. 6:15PM: By around 6ish I had already obtained 2 local proof.txts from the AD, securing 20 points. I was feeling great. All that was left was the domain admin. 6:30PM-01:00AM: The despair kicks in. I had been spinning my wheels for so long on the last part of the AD. When I would spend too much time stuck on the final AD machine I would go do a little bit of work here and there on the standalones. I felt pretty defeated because I went this whole 7 hours pretty much making 0 progress not even getting a foothold on any standalones. I ended up going to bed being sure I was about to fail. 7:30AM: Woke up and ate a protein bar, then started back up again. I was 99% sure I had figured out the path for this standalone the night before but could not get it to work. I tried it again in the morning and it just worked magically. Not sure what happened here. The privesc came a few hours after and only worked after about my third try. Lesson here is don‚Äôt give up if it doesn‚Äôt work the first time. Research backups to your exploits/tools incase one of them fails you can confirm it‚Äôs not a fluke with another version. ~11:30AM: Started working on the second standalone. Due to good enumeration I figured out the foothold quite quickly. Manual enumeration is and always will be key. Got stuck in a rabbit whole for a while but finally got the privesc. ~1:30PM: I had about 2 hours left and realized I only needed one more flag. I was freaking out internally because I didn‚Äôt think I could actually do this. I never went back to the last AD machine and instead focused on the final standalone that I had been putting off. I was so lost and so nervous and didn‚Äôt have much time. I eventually found it and realized it was so much simpler than I was making it. And by golly what do you know, I had enough flags for 70 points by about 3pm, with one hour remaining. Huzzah. 3PM-4PM: Used the last hour to frantically make sure I screenshotted EVERYTHING and did NOT mess up my proof.txt/local.txt screenshots. PLEASE double check your screenshots because I went back through and realized I did not capture the local.txt in one of my screenshots and only the ipconfig. Imagine if I had failed because of that. My score was as follows: 2 AD Proof.txt: 20 points 3 Stanadlone Local.txt: 30 points 2 Standalone Proof.txt: 20 points Total: 70 points Here‚Äôs a list of some resources that came in super handy during my prep and during the exam: ippsec.rocks website - anytime I needed to remember how to do something specific or saw a technology/platform I wasn‚Äôt familiar with, I just went on over to ippsec.rocks and typed it in, often times he was extremely helpful. It‚Äôs quite likely you‚Äôll spend a lot of time googling/researching during the exam and ippsec can save a lot of time when you see something you‚Äôre unfamiliar with. It‚Äôs no secret this guy is a legend. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT08J44ErMmb9qaEeTYl5diQW6jWVHCR2&si=IgWyM3CLy9F6z4Kv - I watched this guy‚Äôs 3 OSCP Active Directory attack paths religiously the weeks before my exam. Definitely watch these and take notes. Follow along with his setup tutorial and set up the lab for yourself if you‚Äôre up to it. Incredible resource imo. https://eins.li/posts/oscp-secret-sauce/ - I saw someone else recommend this resource here and wow, the small tips and tricks here go a long way. Particularly the busybox reverse shell being so consistent and the Mimikatz one liner are super useful and just small things that make life easier/save time. https://github.com/crazywifi/Enable-RDP-One-Liner-CMD - Any time I needed to enable RDP on a box I had this up. Don‚Äôt forget you can use RDP. It makes life a lot easier/quicker when interacting with your target and can establish persistence. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a real engagement so who cares, definitely use this if it makes your life easier. https://www.revshells.com - Amazing site I wish I‚Äôd known about sooner honestly. Easily and quickly generate reverse shell one liners in just about any format imaginable. During my practice the most consistent for me on windows was the powershell base64 one and the busybox netcat for Linux. Final advice: SCREENSHOT EVERYTHING! If it‚Äôs a command you ran to exploit something just screenshot it. You can always decide what is and isn‚Äôt needed after you start the report. But once that exam portion is over there‚Äôs no going back to get new screenshots, your lab access is ripped away. So make sure you got what you need before that 24 hours is up. Screenshot every exploit output and step along the way. I used CherryTree for my notes and had a section under each machine where I just spammed screenshots, and during my report I would pick and choose which ones I needed. Remember that everything is designed to be quite trivial to exploit. Don‚Äôt overcomplicate things. The answer is usually simpler than you think. You got this!","[Author: Traditional_Craft256, Score: 4, Posted: 1731035998.0] Congratulations man!

Being a well rounded technologist prohibits behaviors such as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why this behavior is happening.‚Äù Cyberwarfare centers on communication, and it is always the first place you can see a compromise.

Could've been a remote zero-day that nobody else knew about, could've been some insanely complicated attack with physical proximity and rogue radio signals and stolen certificates, or something else entirely. However, to the question of ""aren't all phones vulnerable"" - speaking as someone who's worked on the fringes of the intelligence community... All phones are almost certainly vulnerable to something, but that's not anything the average person needs to worry about. Usually only nation-state actors have the resources to pull that kind of thing off, and they typically will only do it for a high-value target (like... the lawyer for the incoming President of the United States.) As an example, complex attacks requiring physical proximity would mean they'd need to get an agent close enough to the target to execute the attack. Obviously not impossible, but it requires time and effort, and carries a risk of detection - if you're an intelligence agency and one of your agents gets detected, then the best case is they get arrested/expelled and become useless, and the worst case is counterintelligence agencies use them against you. All that to say, it's only worth trying if the attempt is likely to yield something very valuable. Similarly, a remote zero-day could impact a whole lot of people, but that's not really the best use of a remote zero-day - because once a zero-day is discovered, it becomes useless very quickly. A nation-state actor gets a lot more intelligence benefit out of hacking the phones of a few top-level government officials and not getting noticed, than it does compromising the phones of millions of uninteresting average citizen and getting noticed very quickly.

"How do cryptography jobs look like (after a PhD)? ","Edith_Fabiana","cryptography","12","1731014267.0","11","https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptography/comments/1gm1etg/how_do_cryptography_jobs_look_like_after_a_phd/","I'm considering to apply for a PhD position on cryptography in Europe and if not contuining in academics after this, I would still like to have a research-/development-driven non-academic job. Are there such cryptography jobs out there and if so, is a PhD degree necessary? To give some context and draw a parallel, I've spoken to several PhD students on deep learning claiming such a degree is necessary to land a job developing and/or researching new challenging models instead of performing data exploration and implementation of standardised basic solutions. I feel this is somewhat exaggerated, but there is possibly some truth to it. I try to figure out whether a PhD degree similarly opens doors in cryptography or whether development-/research-driven jobs don't really exist outside of academics? Please let me know if the question is too vague, I tried to keep it short.","[Author: CharlieTrip, Score: 12, Posted: 1731016157.0] To land a job in the crypto-industry (web3), I think that the PhD is not necessary, sometimes even a weight that makes everything more complicated. However, there is a big catch that can facilitate landing a job in this domain. For the normal crypto-jobs, a PhD is mandatory. [I have a PhD in Cryptography, Europe-based, with quite some papers in (too) many research areas. For personal reason, I'm currently moving from academia to industry, thus searching for a job for the last year.] The average job-listing for web3-crypto searches for a ""cryptography researcher"" which effectively is synonymous of ""ZK researcher with implementation experience"" and somehow translates to ""highly experienced go/rust developer with interest in some ZK framework"". The few jobs in standard crypto are basically demanding as a normal academic position. To land a job in the crypto(web3)-market (except maybe 2-3 big-big company), you mainly need to be a skilled programmer with some provable experience/code and some interest in ZK, a minor (not) publication is fine (a.k.a. non peer-reviewed pre-print are considered publication...). I might look harsh, but any rejection I get is motivated exclusively by ""not enough coding experience"" despite the ads requiring only academic experience. A job in normal crypto, well... good papers and a lot of research, basically. Oh, don't get me into the further separation of computer security, a.k.a. basically anything in the intersection of security and code. This is completely different and, to get a job in this, a PhD might be useful but experience and provable projects are more important. My contacts in the ML-PhD world told me that you need a PhD to even do minor implementation jobs and the problem originates by a massive amount of researcher turning into ML-AI experts, raising the average qualification for minor job to something way too high. Personally, if you like solving hard problems, the PhD is a good thing. It is (mentally) hard but a really worth life/work experience. Doing a PhD to land a better job, eeehhh... do a lot of coding projects and put them public, not necessarily publish them. Nowadays, it should be really easy to find these positions since a lot (all, I would say) of PhD in cryptography are turning into development jobs since there is almost no economical reason to do diverse/basic research. [Author: badcryptobitch, Score: 2, Posted: 1731026589.0] This is pretty accurate. However, there are jobs in Web3 that are more focused on the more academic side of crypto as opposed to just implementation. Those jobs can be found at some companies, VC funds and at foundations such as the Ethereum Foundation. However, if you don't already OP, you should start learning Python and Rust/Go to be more competitive for those jobs. Further, being familiar with DSLs in zero-knowledge cryptography (mainly circom but there are others such as Noir and Leo) will be a huge plus as well. [Author: Edith_Fabiana, Score: 1, Posted: 1731052148.0] Thanks! I understand there are some nuances with regards to the jobs in Web3 as well; however, I am not familiar with these languages.

[Author: Edith_Fabiana, Score: 1, Posted: 1731051328.0] Thank you, this is very helpful! Would you argue that for these kind of jobs in ""normal"" crypto, which require good papers and a lot of research, your PhD topics should align (to some extent) with the content of the position? A significant share of research is also focused on post-quantum cryptography, which does sound interesting, but might not be as applicable. On the other hand, you might argue a PhD is not necessarily aimed at gaining directly applicable knowledge anyway.

I'm not very tech savvy so excuse my ignorance. I've been concerned about malware for some time. An ex friend I had told me that a family member of theirs had synced another family members phone to their own. I had a feeling they were spying on me before this and had texted someone about it. Then a month or two later, the ex friend jokey claimed I accessed their youtube account and sent a screenshot of their youtube search page which, amongst their searches, featured an obscure youtuber I had searched for earlier in the day. I checked on my google account for any unfamilar devices and I couldn't see any and ru An a malware scan which said I was okay. I cut then off for other reasons and over a year has passed and i've since switched to another device. I had forgot about this until recently when I noticed something strange. I was on tiktok and pressed on the add account button and there, I found an unfamilar account which said 'google' underneath it. I'm the only person that I know of who has access to my gmail and other accounts. I searched the unfamilar account username up and it was active. I screenshotted my findings of the account on my 'add account' list. I tried clicking on the account to see if I could login ( i couldnt, it just took me to a page where it said 'choose your account'). A few days later, I clicked back on the 'add account' button to see if the account was still there and only a ghost of the account remains. I re-searched the account and it has totally disappeared off the site. If the account hadnt disappeared after the I screenshotted the account on my own 'add accounts' I wouldnt be so suspicious. I wonder if you know any ways of how I can identify really sophisticated malware (as my ex friend was very very good with technology) and help me ascertain my threat level?

OPSEC is a mindset and thought process, not a single solution ‚Äî meaning, when asking a question it's a good idea to word it in a way that allows others to teach you the mindset rather than a single solution. Here's an example of a bad question that is far too vague to explain the threat model first: I want to stay safe on the internet. Which browser should I use? Here's an example of a good question that explains the threat model without giving too much private information: I don't want to have anyone find my home address on the internet while I use it. Will using a particular browser help me? Here's a bad answer (it depends on trusting that user entirely and doesn't help you learn anything on your own) that you should report immediately: You should use X browser because it is the most secure. Here's a good answer to explains why it's good for your specific threat model and also teaches the mindset of OPSEC: Y browser has a function that warns you from accidentally sharing your home address on forms, but ultimately this is up to you to control by being vigilant and no single tool or solution will ever be a silver bullet for security. If you follow this, technically you can use any browser! If you see anyone offering advice that doesn't feel like it is giving you the tools to make your own decisions and rather pushing you to a specific tool as a solution, feel free to report them.

The Mountain Fire, northwest of Los Angeles near Camarillo, led to evacuations for over 10,000 people and threatened 3,500 structures in nearby communities and farmland. Federal aid was approved after Governor Newsom requested assistance. The fire expanded rapidly, covering 16 square miles within hours, while thick smoke blanketed neighborhoods and hindered visibility for firefighters and residents. As of this morning, the fire is at 14,187 acres and a red flag warning will remain in effect until 6 pm. Winds are forecast to strengthen through midday before steadily easing into the overnight. Hurricane Rafael Causes Power Grid Failure in Cuba: Hurricane Rafael struck Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane on Wednesday, causing severe damage before weakening to Category 2 and entering the Gulf of Mexico. Conditions in Western Cuba were expected to improve overnight as winds, rain, and storm surge subsided. However, the storm caused a power grid failure across the island. Rafael is the fifth major Atlantic hurricane of the year and the strongest to hit this late in the season since 2020. Israel Passes Law to Deport Families of Palestinian Attackers: Israel‚Äôs parliament passed a law today allowing the deportation of family members of Palestinian attackers‚Äîincluding Israeli citizens‚Äîto Gaza or other areas. The law passed by a 61-41 vote and is expected to face legal challenges. It targets Palestinian citizens of Israel and East Jerusalem residents who either knew about or supported relatives' involvement in attacks. Under the law, deported individuals could be sent to Gaza or elsewhere for 7 to 20 years. Israeli Airstrikes Kill at Least 40 in Lebanon: Israeli strikes across Lebanon killed at least 40 people on Wednesday, with targets reportedly including Hezbollah operatives in Baalbek and Bekaa. One strike damaged a historic Ottoman-era building near Baalbek‚Äôs Roman ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Additional strikes hit Southern Beirut, where Israel targeted Hezbollah command centers, weapons storage, and other infrastructure. The IDF issued evacuation warnings for multiple neighborhoods in Southern Beirut, including areas near Lebanon‚Äôs international airport, which remains operational despite the strikes. Germany's Chancellor Fires Finance Minister: Germany's governing coalition collapsed after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed Finance Minister Christian Lindner, citing a lack of trust between the two leaders.

Port-level access control utilizes 802.1x, or similar network access control protocols, such as certificates, and may incorporate user and/or device authentication. Does this now apply to ALL wired ports on the network? TBH, outside of the DOD, I have yet to see an environment where wired port access is 802.1x controlled. Which means if the site is deploying a desktop on that port, especially a domain joined Windows computers, it might get tricky. On the wireless side the site is 802.1x. But not on the wired side. The way I am reading the control, it seems to be requiring that wired ports be 802.1x authenticated.","[Author: Skusci, Score: 2, Posted: 1731040169.0] Yeah it's not super convenient. Basically for initial commissioning you need to have an alternate way to authorize a network connection for the domain join. Stick a ""commissioning"" certificate on something like a yubikey. It can even be the same cert used to login a domain user account with join privileges. If you are being proper, using it to authenticate will stick you on a restricted vlan with no network access to internal resources except a domain controller. Once it's setup, updates downloaded, gpos applied, etc, you can then let it connect to the internal vlan with its own cert. "

If yes you might be able to dump a flash chip if the I2C connector is connected to the flash chip. Inside the dump there might be your Zigbee key. Another option would be to hookup an logic analyzer and listen to the pin with the label ""Zigbee_key"". You might be able to sniff some senitive information from there.

[Author: Drumdevil86, Score: 2, Posted: 1730975905.0] AFAIK, the data inside 802.15.4 frames are encrypted based on the Zigbee network key. This key is generated by the Zigbee Coordinator and passed to the client device when it's being paired into the network. When you sniff a Zigbee network, you can decrypt the packets using Wireshark and the key set in the Coordinator. If it's a universal coordinator, you can easily find the key in it's management software. As soon as a client device is reset, it will unpair itself from the network and forget the key. What kind of device is it? [Author: RumpClapper, Score: 1, Posted: 1730983905.0] I should have clarified while the hardware says zigbee on it, it is producing regular ieee 802.15.4 multipurpose frames with no keys passed (I am using the Nordic NRF Sniffer in Wireshark), the only thing that is encrypted is the last 8 hex bytes out of a 24 byte frame. It isn‚Äôt doing anything super complex, this is just a camera wireless follow focus system, it basically is just telling a motor to go forward or backwards in realtime from a handle knob. I am trying to decrypt the command portion of this frame so I can construct my own frames with an outside controller instead of using an array of captured frames and manually marking the values that correspond to control values. The motor device also sends a validating frame that corresponds to the controller frame sent. On its PCB there are two spots on the board that say Key 1 and Key 2, I am assuming key 1 would be what the motor uses to interpret the handles incoming frames, and key 2 would be what is used to construct the encryption of the last 8 bytes on the validating frames. [Author: RumpClapper, Score: 1, Posted: 1730988824.0] Here is a dissection of the data portion of the frames: Handle Frame: 05 aa 32 4d f6 fe ff 5f ae 0c 04 00 08 1f 0e 28 e2 51 f0 fa 15 ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ Static Data ^^ Sequence Number ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ Encrypted Data Corresponding Motor Validation Frame: 05 aa 39 a1 bf fe ff 08 ac 70 04 00 08 06 f3 c1 d6 9b bd f1 47 ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ Static Data ^^ Sequence Number ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ Encrypted Data The display on the handle shows positions 000-999, but I have determined by sniffing there are much smaller increments than what is shown on the handle.

The only value incrementing byte is the sequence byte.  [Author: what-the-puck, Score: 1, Posted: 1730990790.0] I expected it would be the opposite - that every time the device joined the network, or on a schedule, it would authenticate using the network password or whatever, but that data transmissions would happen with an ephemeral node-node key. But maybe that makes pairing and hopping needlessly complex or increases storage space on devices without value. I haven't read the standard [Author: RumpClapper, Score: 2, Posted: 1730992845.0] In this case, there is no destination specified or pan id from the device, it is broadcasting the frames in a way that any device could intercept. I have verified that the sender doesn't matter by creating an array of frames sniffed by slowly turning the knob from 000-999, I have then broadcasted the frames in that array sequentially on a esp32 c6 and the motor responds just fine with no key in use. I would rather not have an array of 4095 frames and use a constructor function to save room in the limited program memory.

Thought it might be helpful for you. Apparently, the dev was inspired by another app called Wasted by x13a, which could factory reset a device under duress using triggers like a special password or USB connection. While that‚Äôs great, factory resets can be obvious and risky if the person holding your device realizes what's going on. This app takes it up a notch by discreetly wiping data within a specific user profile, then uninstalling or hiding itself so it leaves as few traces as possible. You can set it up to wipe data if a duress password is entered on the lock screen, if a USB device connects without approval, or after repeated failed password attempts. There are some other features available: disabling logs to hide apps actions, disabling safe boot mode and running TRIM after data destruction. App has versions disguised as other apps to make detection of it traces in system harder. Looks interesting for me, though I'm not sure to what extent renaming package will protect against finding traces of app activity on device. Also app requires root rights for most advanced functions and you must use ADB to install it. You can check it out on GitHub for the full rundown. I'd also be happy for any comments on it, specifically about its trustworthiness","[Author: Artemis-Arrow-795, Score: 3, Posted: 1730242028.0] that looks interesting, I'll check it out, thanks  [Author: ExplorerIntrepid7174, Score: 2, Posted: 1730233182.0] Easiest way to download?

Evidence points conclusively to AT&T having a second, very recent, data breach. Since they took 3 months to report the April one, and I personally had financial trouble from that, I'm posting this here for public information. How I found out: I have Cricket Wireless, which is owned by AT&T. I have multiple checking accounts, and earlier this summer, one of the accounts' debit card was used for fraudulent online purchasing (hundreds of dollars of MLM perfume). The debit card was cancelled and re-issued, and I only updated the card information with Cricket. The new card has not left my filebox, and has not been used for anything but Cricket autopay for my cheap cell phone. Today, I got a call from VISA asking if I had used that card this month for Cricket (yes) and some online clothing store I have never heard of (hell no). The data is only in one place-- Cricket, aka AT&T-- and has been breached in the two months since I got the new card. Ergo, AT&T has *another* data breach, one that happened in the last 2 months.","[Author: runtcip_, Score: 2, Posted: 1728595943.0] Yep; Leak exposed addresses with an old landline I had; I also suspect some voting activism platforms used their services.

This scam is a variation of the verify/pin scam. You will receive a message from someone who is asking for your help to log into their account. This message could be from a contact you trust, but the account is actually compromised. They will either ask you to add their email or phone number to your own account, or ask you to receive a verification link that you will copy and send to them. Either way, these steps will allow the scammer to change your password and lock you out of your account. If your account was stolen there is a way of reversing that yourself. You don't need professional services and ignore anyone reaching you in private with offers of hacking it back. Those are scammers. Make an effort recovering your account. A taken over account is a tool for scammers, you want to stop that. You can recover a Facebook or Instagram account with a simple step. Every time a scammer takes over your account, Meta will email you about it. Read this guide from Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/help/203305893040179 which basically says that if the email address of your account has been changed, you'll receive an email from security@facebookmail.com to undo the change - If you can't find that email, visit this page and follow the steps: https://facebook.com/hacked Read this guide from Instagram: https://help.instagram.com/368191326593075 - same as above, but the email comes from security@mail.instagram.com - If you can't find that email, visit this page and follow the steps: https://instagram.com/hacked I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There isn't a specific tool for their removal and the tool you described is way too flimsy to do the job. The way I have been doing it for a decade as a repair tech is to use an xacto blade with a square tip (#17) to weaken all of the solder joints that you have easy access to, then use a pair of side cutters to grab and pull the shield off. This will often pull up some of the ground plane but it's just cosmetic. Now that I'm working in a forensic lab, I use a CNC to mill the perimeter of the shield. You could also use a Dremel but it would require a very careful hand. Removing with heat is, in my opinion, more risky. These shields are often held on with the same alloy as the rest of the components, so you risk sliding components around during removal. If there are underfilled BGA ICs under the shield or on the opposite side of the board then there's a high risk that you'll overheat these and cause bridging which would then mean that you have to remove the ic, clean off all of the solder and underfill, and reinstall the ic. Older iPhones (8 and earlier) used a lower temperature solder on the shields so they were easy to remove with heat without any risk. For modern iPhones and all androids I would not recommend the hot air method. Look up the videos Jessa from iPad Rehab has posted on youtube about shield removal. "

It's about the fact no company, not even amazon and google, have the budget or talent pool to cover all the things they need to do. So instead, the goal is to treat security like SRE and reduce the toil (non productive button clicking work) and focus entirely on engineering efforts that scale with the company. Automation and platform engineering are a big part of that, but it's not less security; it's doing security in a way that scales like delivering a product or service to internal/external customers. Second the niche jobs are more about where you are and how you're applying a skillset. For example exploit development and research is like 90% AppSec focusing on fuzzing, software analysis, etc. The exact same skills as doing DevSecOps at a serious level. Just being applied differently. So my best suggestion would be to hit SRE and DevSecOps and AppSec methodologies hard and get a very strong foundation.

I know my servers PHP info is easy to access on my shared hosting plan. So I received the following email about PHP Info Exposure on my site. Something to worry about or someone just fishing for some money for something that isn't an issue? EMAIL: Hello, I hope this email finds you well. My name is Ali Adam, and I am a bug hunter and security researcher. In my spare time, I seek out vulnerabilities on websites to help improve their security while also earning a living. Recently, I discovered and reported a potential issue on your website through Open Bug Bounty. However, I suspect that you may not have received the notification due to some delays on their servers. Therefore, I wanted to reach out directly via email to ensure you have all the details of the bug report. Title of Bug: PHP Info Exposure on jaymarroquin.com Overview: During a bug bounty hunting session, a PHP Info page was discovered on jaymarroquin.com. This page exposes sensitive configuration details about the server's PHP environment, which can be leveraged by attackers to perform targeted attacks, such as exploiting known vulnerabilities, identifying installed extensions, and gathering information about the server's file system. Vulnerability Details: Affected URL: https://jaymarroquin.com/phpinfo.php Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure Description: The file PhpInfo on the jaymarroquin.com domain contains a call to the phpinfo() function, which outputs detailed information about the PHP environment. This information includes the PHP version, server details, loaded extensions, environment variables, and more. An attacker can use this data to identify weaknesses in the server configuration and potentially craft specific attacks against the server. Steps to Reproduce: 1- Open a web browser and navigate to the following URL: https://jaymarroquin.com/phpinfo.php 2- The PHP Info page will be displayed, revealing detailed configuration and environment information about the server. Impact: Server Fingerprinting:Attackers can fingerprint the server based on the disclosed PHP version, server software, and installed modules, allowing them to identify specific vulnerabilities to exploit. Sensitive Information Disclosure: The output may include sensitive information such as environment variables, file paths, and configuration settings that could be used to further compromise the server. Targeted Attacks: With the detailed information provided by the PHP Info page, attackers can perform targeted attacks against known vulnerabilities in the disclosed PHP version or installed extensions. Recommendation for Mitigation: Remove or Restrict Access to PHPInfo Pages: Immediately remove the PhpInfo file or restrict access to the PHP Info page by limiting it to authorized personnel only. This can be achieved by using access control mechanisms such as IP whitelisting or password protection. Regularly Audit Server Files: Conduct regular audits of server files to ensure that sensitive files like PHP Info pages are not publicly accessible. Keep PHP and Extensions Updated: Ensure that PHP and all installed extensions are regularly updated to the latest versions to mitigate the risk of known vulnerabilities being exploited. Minimize Information Disclosure: Configure the PHP environment to minimize information disclosure by disabling expose_php, setting display_errors to Off, and ensuring that sensitive information is not included in the output. I do this work to alert you to potential security issues on your website, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could consider providing a bounty for the bug I discovered. Such rewards motivate me to continue hunting for vulnerabilities and helping to secure websites like yours. If possible, I would be grateful if you could send the reward to my PayPal account: alihunter.adam@gmail.com Additionally, I am happy to create an invoice for the transfer if that is more convenient for you. I look forward to working together to enhance the security of your company's websites. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

[Author: AutoModerator, Score: 5, Posted: 1730998106.0] Hi /u/great_molassesflood, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam. The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money. Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared. When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

Recovery scams target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \""recovery agents\"" or hackers. When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply advance-fee scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying. If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers. Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Supercookies and all the alternative options they can use to put data somewhere in your browser where it doesn't actually check for that information or clean it out ever has been abused for a long time. I'm not sure why it's legal other than it's pretty hard to enforce a law against this when they have basically made cookies mandatory for most site functionality and there's so many methods of doing this, it's kind of a pointless battle just from the structure of the internet itself. Most of your browsers information is publicly available too when connecting to sites by default. Richard stallman has done a lot of good lectures about this and talks about the famous example of how social media buttons are used to track you even if you don't use social media. Essentially, you're automatically forced to make a request to their servers if a site has them installed which in turn provides them any and all public information your browser is set to give them. This kind of tracking is out of control, when you connect to some major website you‚Äôre likely connecting to dozens of other domains of sites you‚Äôve never even heard of and providing them all sorts of information for them to store and collect. Then those 3rd party sites may send you somewhere else too which in turn stores some kind of cookie on your browser etc etc etc. They can then use all this to build a profile of where you go and where you've been provided you're going to sites using the feature even with 0 accounts or active participation. It's very sophisticated to the point where actual standard cookies are like the least of my worries since they're easy to remove, it‚Äôs all the tracking in between that is a real problem even for privacy conscious people.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored. Scammers spoof the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. Here is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment. A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut. I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

"Nearly Fell for Jury Duty Phone Scam","KaiWenXiao","Scams","27","1731012499.0","24","https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1gm0peb/nearly_fell_for_jury_duty_phone_scam/","So sorry for how lengthy this is.... I feel like a fool but here's my story from today. Please keep in mind that I know absolutely nothing about law enforcement processes... I was at work and got a phone call from my local area code, I missed it and they left a voicemail saying ""this is officer _____ from the ____ police department. If you would please give me a call back as soon as possible."" so I called back spoke to the officer. He had a deep southern accent, spoke like an officer would speak too, it was extremely convincing. He told me that I had a warrant for my arrest due to missing jury duty. I had a little laugh about it because I didn't think it was that big of a deal and told him how that sucks cause I've always wanted to have jury duty (not even joking.) I explained to him that there was about 3 week span last month where I did not receive any mail, which is true. For about 3 weeks in October I didn't receive a single letter, not even coupons. I went and spoke to the post office about it and then the next day I started receiving mail again, so something was going on there. Anyway he said okay I understand, well what we are going to have you do is fill out these forms and give your statement. He then told me to come down to the police department which he gave me the address for and told me that I need to stay on the phone with him the entire time not to hang up and not to mute the call, I figured this must have been for security so they know I'm not trying to run or talk to someone for help to get out of it. So I did, I told him I was in the car and on the way. Before I left I texted my wife and told her what was happening and that I was going to the police department, she immediately was on her guard and told me she was going there as well. As I was driving there he told me to give him my ETA and also give him step by step information on my travels so I told him ""driving down this road, stopping at stop sign, turning right, etc."" About 5 minutes into the drive he told me that his lieutenant brought to his attention some paperwork I needed to read and to pull over somewhere safe and let him know when I was parked. I pulled over into a fire department parking lot and he sent me over an image that was an ""order for arrest"". He had me read it word for word (which re reading it now I don't think there was anything in it that they could use against me). Anyway reading through it out loud for the first time I read where it says that I am to be arrested and detained and that my bond has been set for $8,500. He asked if I understand what I read and I said I did. He then proceeded to tell me, that because there is an order for my arrest if I were to come to the police department they would be required to place me under arrest and detain me for 2-3 days until the proper paperwork could be processed. He then said that however if I were to bring in a ""bond stamp"" to the police station that they would not have to arrest me and I would not have an arrest on my permanent record. I would say this is where I started feeling slightly suspicious but still to scared to question anything until I knew for sure. My wife was almost to the police department at this point. I told him that I didn't have $8,500 and that I could try and ask family for the money, he said to give him a minute and then came back and said he got approval from their ""finance department"" for a partial payment on the bond for the time being which is when he asked me how much I could pay and I told him what I could pay and he left again for a second and came back and said that they would accept that partial payment. I asked if I should just go to the courthouse and purchase the bond there and he told me that's not how it works that you need to go to a ""money center"" to purchase a ""bond stamp"". He said that he would send me a document to present to the money center who would approve the bond stamps after the purchase and then I would bring the stamp to the police department and as long as I appeared in court on my court date the bond would be refunded. So he then directed me to go to Walmart money center and that's where I could purchase the bond. Now my spidey senses are really tingling. So I start heading to Walmart. At this point my wife is at the police station and she goes in to talk to someone, I send her all the documents this guy has sent me, give her his name and all the information I have via text. I pull into the Walmart parking lot and park and let him know. Now he sends me this barcode via text and says to show it to the money center employee and tell them I need to purchase a ""go to bond"" I think is what he called it for the amount I told them I could pay. Now my wife is in the police station and so I'm walking very slowly from the back of the parking lot into Walmart while I'm waiting to hear back from her what she finds out from the police department. I get inside and lie to the scammer and tell him there's a long line for the money center so it's going to be awhile. So I keep him on the phone and go look at yugioh cards like any grownup would while my wife talks to the sheriff and he pulls my name up and sees that there is no warrant out for my arrest, he confirms there's no officer by that name in the police department and tells me that the judge who signed for the arrest has been retired for over 10 years now. At this point everything I needed to know is confirmed so I ask ""officer are you still there"" he says yes and I proceed to inform him that my wife is at the sheriffs office right now and that judge _____ has been retired for over 10 years and asked him if he could explain why that is. He says ""well....that's the courts for you"" I then lose my cool a little bit and tell him to go fuck himself and then I tell him how he was really convincing and almost had me there and asked him how many people he gets with this out of my own curiosity and he just kind of mumbled a response I'm sure just totally off guard that he had been caught. I then told him to go find a church and again to go fuck himself....my brain was a little scattered... he then said chillingly ""well, I guess I'll move onto the next one."" and hung up. I did some sleuthing, added his phone number to my contacts and was able to get a ""friend suggestion"" via snapchat associated with his phone number which had his name on it. So I called the sheriff's office and gave them the phone number and the persons name that I had found. And that's the end of the story. Very embarrassed by this whole encounter, but gosh was it believable!

When sending syslog from the substation gear, monitoring the HMI‚Äôs with windows events, and even monitoring firewall alerts, There is still a LOT we can miss that Dragos has caught. I‚Äôve seen that Dragos can offer a lot of visibility and insight into what is going on that you can‚Äôt get from just syslog monitoring. It also help that it is very aware of OT protocols, so while doing it‚Äôs network monitoring it can identify what is happening with those switches. It is very easy for a red team (or bad actors) to completely bypass your HMI to send instructions to your edge, but Dragos can help identify those actions and alert on them. They also have a good asset inventory capability which can help map the devices it sees on the network, and in turn can alert if it seems something new show up. There are a lot of network based detection systems out there, but there are not a lot which are so OT focused and aware, so it can give you a better quality and quantity of alerts than something designed for a standard IT network. Dragos also has some good benefits outside of their monitors as well, such as their threat intelligence services and knowledge.

I lost my job and was looking on the marketplace for a plan to cover the gap I'd have until my new jobs health insurance kicked in. I thought I requested phone assistance while on the heathcare dot gov website, but it turned out to be a premier rep. The good news is that it's not a scam, technically. It's just really expensive, minimal coverage rolled up into other plans you don't need and a bunch of other stuff that is free. The brokers are a bunch of pyramid scheme people who rely on the complexity of healthcare to utilize high-pressure sales tactics and misinformation.They enrolled me in two policies to the tune of 800 dollars without informing me. My post history has the saga of how I got my money back in detail, but the gist of it is this: Don't beleive hour premier rep. They will tell you they can't cancel your plan without you providing the information of the policy you chose. They will also tell you they will refund you and not do it. Call them as a formality and document who you talked to: names, days, etc. Plan on being on hold an hour or more. Go to your online or in person bank and initiate a transaction dispute. Tell them about the conversation with the premier employee. You'll be sent an onboarding email from the insurance company. Decline the coverage. Call them and request a refund. Inform them that you have contacted your bank and will be reporting this to the local insurance licensing board. Your premier rep should have a name and license number in the documents you were sent. Get this, along with the insuring agency's info. Go to your local government insurance licensing body and file a complaint. Email, call, and document. Depending on your state, insurers may not legally turn a profit from enrollment fees alone. If you cancel, insist on a full refund. They will try to tell you that enrollment fees are not refundable, but you can fight this, especially if the plan has not gone into effect. Freeze your credit with all 3 agencies now. It took me 5 minutes. Everyone should be doing this anyway. Consider replacing your payment card. Best of luck. This situation was a headache, and these people are the scum of the earth.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money. Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared. When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

The advance-fee scam arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing. It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments. If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again.

Refund scams usually start with a spam email about a fake transaction, although they can also be sent through SMS or any other messaging service. The message will provide you with a phone number to call if you want to cancel the transaction, and if you call the scammers will try to get you to provide credit card or banking information in order to receive your refund.

The advance-fee scam arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing. It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments. If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again.

And from now if anyone won't give an age or they don't have it clearly written on their profile report them then block. I hope this helps.

He had a little badge on his shirt that said ‚Äújoin the Kirby team‚Äù or something like that. He unboxed it to show it was new, but the machine was obviously dirty/previously used while he was taking it out and putting it together, I don‚Äôt know what significance it being new had? His ‚Äúcleaning solution‚Äù was a bubbly liquid inside of a water bottle. He vacuumed for a bit and cleaned one window. While he was doing his sales pitch, I expressed if we were to purchase it, it would definitely need to be financed because we don‚Äôt have the funds for an upfront purchase like that, it seemed to push him away a bit and he wanted to leave it here and come back later to finish the cleaning. I insisted he should take it with him but he was even more persistent on leaving it and coming back later to finish the job. He said he would come back later when the man was home to do the actual cleaning demo (I know. Bad move letting him know he wasn‚Äôt here.) he left no information, no card, no company name, a white van pulled up and he got inside and left. It was a normal sales pitch experience in the beginning but by the end I felt verrrry uneasy. I didn‚Äôt sign anything, I didn‚Äôt agree to buy anything, I‚Äôm just confused and pretty concerned after the experience. I put it all out on the front porch for him to come collect later and I‚Äôm deciding I‚Äôm not gonna answer the door again. Edit#1:I have called non emergency just in case to let them know what happened. They said they will have an officer contact me. Edit #2: Sheriff called me, I told him what happened and he asked if I wanted anything done as of right now, nothing has happened yet so I told them I just wanted to make sure they were aware because if they come back and cause a fuss I‚Äôll definitely need assistance from law enforcement. Edit #3: UPDATE, it‚Äôs dark out now but the same guy came back and picked it up, didn‚Äôt knock on the door or anything, then walked to the curb and sat down, looks like he‚Äôs waiting for a ride. I feel bad, but I guess the message was clear enough that we weren‚Äôt interested and he was respectful of that and decided not to pester about it. Will update if anything else comes of it, but this looks like it for now. Day after edit: I watched the clip with sound on this morning (didn‚Äôt while I was at work) after he picked it up and packed it all back in the box he left a farewell message: ‚Äúsorry you guys can‚Äôt afford it have a nice night godbless‚Äù.

TLDR: Fuck Kirby Corp. But the vacuums are TOP OF THE LINE BEYOND GOOD, nothing is remotely comparable. So get them used and super cheap instead. Kirby's are top of the line, kick ass, GREAT vacuums. They're built like a tank and as heavy as one, but with a metal chassis on which the ""vehicle"" of a vacuum is built, including a transmission that makes it feel weightless. You have to be careful because the thing will suck up your cat from down stairs through the fucking ceiling. Your great grand kids will still be using it long after you're gone, and may even have an argument over who gets it. They are the Luxury Trim Lexus workhorse of the vacuum world, only they make Toyota vehicles look ""disposable"" in terms of longevity. That said... The company itself is absolutely fucking stupid. And I'm desperately refraining from using additional descriptive terms involving small school busses, that are no longer politically correct. They are somehow still stuck in this 1950's door to door sales mentality, treat their ""employees"" like garbage, and use sales tactics that were once common and acceptable, but now are seen as hostile, predatory, and flat out Malevolent. And for reasons unfathomable, they have not evolved... but equally unfathomable, have managed to remain in business. If they had a single ounce of sense, they would re-brand themselves as a premium product manufacturer (think Yetti coolers) because the product is fucking LEGIT, but it needs to be addressed to the appropriate market that wants and can afford the ultra luxury, above commercial grade, performance quality they're offering. (Dysons certainly work, but they're a flip top igloo cooler vs. a Yetti). But unfortunately, Kirby corporation continues to be idiotic, and borderline evil. IF you want one of these at a reasonable price, and don't want to give Kirby Corp money (at least until they stop being asshats)... here is what we did. Go to your nearest pawn shop, and I can almost promise you that you will find at least 3... if you don't, go to another one and find their minimum of 3 in stock. You will not have to look for long. You can usually pick up a full setup for about $200-400 depending on age, accessories, mood of the shop, etc. (less than a new Dyson). You want a ""recent"" model that has the transmission switch on the back that toggles back and forth, and by recent, I mean one made in the last 25 or so years. (you will find fully functional 30-50 year old machines, not joking, that are still going strong, that can take modern HEPPA filter bags, but just don't have the transmission) ATTACHMENTS: The shampoo thing is nice, but not a huge deal. The carpet attachment (Beater bars), the hose attachment, and the hard tubes/floor attachments, brushes and such are the critical ones, I think they have a tiny beater bar thing used for furniture that is pretty cool, we don't have it... The other accessories (liquid sprayers, carpet ""fluffer"", and whatever TF else) if included are bonus points, but not really ever used.

Arson investigators will comb the house looking for ignition sources, fire spread, etc. I was the Supervisor of our crime scene unit and also part of the arson task force. I would document any evidence the arson investigators pointed out, and collect any evidence. It can be a slow, painstaking process, especially since we often have to comb through water damage to collect anything. In my experience, it could be a day, it could be three or four days, it all depends on the size of the house, how much of the house was involved, etc. "
"NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO ASK BUT: Unknown IP Used for Suspicious Login","Dayshinez","VPN","1","1731007081.0","2","https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/1glyjyn/not_sure_if_this_is_the_right_place_to_ask_but/","Hi everyone! Today, my grandpa asked me to check his Microsoft account because he received a notification about a password change (see the first picture). I decided to investigate by checking the IP address associated with this change to see if it matched his usual login location. It didn‚Äôt. Since he only uses his email on his laptop, it‚Äôs highly unlikely this login was his‚Äîespecially as the IP location was in a very public place. He managed to reset his password (see the second picture) after some effort, which was fortunate. I‚Äôm not exactly an expert in IP tracking (or anything of the sort), and I‚Äôve only recently started looking into this kind of issue, so I‚Äôm unsure if my concerns are completely justified. But I am worried: How could someone have accessed his account and changed the password? Could his data have been leaked? And are his other assets potentially at risk? Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far to protect his account: 1. Changed his password. 2. Enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) for all logins. 3. Added my email as a backup recovery option in addition to his phone number. Can anyone advise on additional steps to ensure any of his other sensitive credentials and information is safe? Thanks in advance for any guidance.","[Author: TrappedInVR, Score: 2, Posted: 1731009103.0] If he used the same password and email combination anywhere else, change it.

Its probably bots checking for leaked email addresses + passwords and trying to sign in to check if account is valid. (See IHaveBeenPwned if email was ever leaked) "

If a bunch of our inventory shows up being sold by a reseller, we get cut off. So, ask him how he's going to track and report the serials he sells. Obviously, you and we know this is a scam.

I trust that all of my friends on instagram don't care about it and I have no family on social media so I'm not too concerned there. I'm more concerned about what they could do with that video since it has my face in it. Is it possible for them to falsely accuse me or send it onto the overall wide internet? I made a really stupid move in the moment of the blocking everything then DELETING all the chats. I later found this thread and realized I shouldn't have deleted the chats and I should've instead taking screen shots of everything. Will I still be fine? All I have is a screen shot of her threatening me and saying ""So you want to fight huh"" ""Okay I'll show you no mercy"". I feel like a complete idiot falling for this cause I usually ward it off and see it coming, but I guess I was just really down bad this time and fell for it. It was so obvious as well, broken english, no personal details, weird times of contact. I feel so stupid. I blocked them and reported them immediately then sought help from the internet as usual. I first found the FBI post and did everything that was said there like NCII and the Internet crimes report. I don't have much info about the girl who did it other than their dating profile and their social media profile names. I've gone completely missing on the internet basically, all social media deactivated or completely privated with max private settings. Anything with my real name has been changed and the little social media I was already using deleted. All my friends are notified there's a scammer using my likeness. Family won't ever find out since they don't use social media in the first place. So basically I'm not too concerned about my nudes being shared, tbh the bros would laugh their asses off. Is there anything else I should do or have I done everything I can do at this point and should just wait it out? I'm mostly concerned if they will try to use it for anything else.

The advance-fee scam arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing. It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments. If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again.

So scammers would simply send victims money by Zelle as part of their scam, and then complain to Zelle that it was a mistake and get their money back from Zelle. That's why you also can't reverse transfers made by CashApp or by PayPal friends and family, and it's why the recipient pays money to PayPal if they want to receive money as a merchant (a transfer that CAN be reversed as you suggest).

It will follow the trail of stolen money from the victim to the the final transaction in the chain, going to a real bank account, and thats you. The bank will recover that money from you. However, the money you send to the scammer is not part of a scam. It's just you paying somebody through Zelle, like you would pay anyone else. Its not even going to a real account that the bank can access. By the time they trace it, the scammer will have spent that money and the account will not lead to them. [Author: realbobenray, Score: 1, Posted: 1731025074.0] I just don't think that's how it works. Cash is fungible. If you steal some, and there's some there in your account, the bank goes after it. You can't launder it simply by sending it to someone else and having them send you other cash back. It's still just money sitting in the account, and the bank will go after it. That trail will end right there, because they got the money they were looking for. If the scammer can spend your money, he can also spend the money that he gave to you originally. Why go through an extra couple of steps? [Author: quaderrordemonstand, Score: 1, Posted: 1731027192.0] sending it to someone else and having them send you other cash back That's pretty much exactly how money laundering works.

However, I wouldn't say it is a ""wrong"" decision, it just depends on what is most important to you. If you love the tool and am happy to continue paying for it, I think that's great, but it is important to hone in on the emotions you're feeling (fear) of being compromised through either of those methods. The odds of being compelled to ""give access"" to your stuff are incredibly low, unless you're up to bad business that would you get attention from bad actors. Keep in mind that some people are uncomfortable with any passwords or keys in the cloud whatsoever, and they keep a KeepassXC locally. For myself, I love Bitwarden very much, and I take the risk because I enjoy the cloud sync between all my devices. I have calendar reminders to back up an encrypted copy of my vault every three months just in case something bad happens. Anyway, in summary... personal opinion, you're not being paranoid, BUT, the decision to move to a non-cloud based password manager is a really strong/big decision for security posture. I hope that helps, and good luck on your privacy journey!

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money. Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared. When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam.

This has caused my anxiety so much that I've been scared to even use chrome and especially since recently I found out my phone will no longer be getting updates. Even though most cases I've seen on reddit involve PCs which I don't have I know it can still happen on mobile devices. I have multiple questions and I probably ask for more in the replies. First of all how does it happen especially to google accounts? Is it a rare occurrence? Can the websites I use do this or does it need to be websites that I have accounts on? Is My google account always in danger since chrome always uses it? How can I stay safe from stuff like this even after setting up like this especially phone that recently stopped getting updates? And lastly should I take break from looking at subbed like these?

One thing most of these cases (if not all, but only Sith deal in absolutes) are the result of users being tricked into executing a local file - most often, these are pirated games or hacks, compromised friend accounts asking to ‚Äòtry out a game they coded‚Äô or old-fashioned phishing strategies. As for ‚Äòwhy Google‚Äô, that is simple and the same reason why most malware is aimed at Windows machines - market share. Google is one of those accounts almost everyone has, and consequently the target where identical steps yield the highest potential gains. The steps you have already taken are well-informed and solid defensive measures to harden your account but - for the moment - you are very unlikely to run into any session or cookie stealers of you stay away from unknown/pirated programs and do not open unknown email attachments, no matter how tempting or enraging they seem. I would still highly recommend unique passwords, a password manager and 2FA even on ‚Äòunknown‚Äô accounts, since even unimportant accounts very likely help an adversary‚Äôs lateral movement to breach other accounts of you or others.

They will offer a good price for a pet with papers, however they will not be able to meet you in real life, and will only sell you the pet with the use of a shipping/courier/freight service. The scammer will demand payment via irreversible payment methods such as Cash App, Venmo, Western Union, or cryptocurrency. The websites they use are usually very easy to spot, as the domain will have been registered recently, and the images they use should be findable using reverse image search. Once you pay the scammers and they know they have you, they will demand more and more fees for things like airline insurance, crating fees, papers, import permits, etc. If you are involved in a pet scam, you need to stop talking with the scammers and dispute any transactions that you are able to dispute.

Background in software development and currently working network security. Studied for about 6 months for at least an hour a day but went about it the wrong way in the beginning. I attempted to read the OSG but it‚Äôs so boring, so I bought the audiobook which I got through 50% of until I realized it was going in one ear and out the other. Turned to destination certification mind maps which imo are the best resource out there and a great place to start. I used learnZap had about 1500 questions in and a readiness of 77% but really think this tool is better suited for learning concepts, it didn‚Äôt really mirror the questions on the exam at all for me. I also tried Quantum tests and did about 400 questions there, they are overly tricky in my opinion but written in the closest style to the exam, DON‚ÄôT let your confidence waiver after taking these tests. I was steady getting 50-60% right and thought I was going to bomb the exam. During the exam I felt great after the first 20 or so questions then they got insanely harder and that confidence went straight down. Used my instincts and picked the best answer I thought fit the question. The ‚Äúthink like a manager‚Äù approach really was over emphasized in my opinion or I was just given a more technical exam. Don‚Äôt think you can just think like a manager and pass, you have to know your concepts and you have to know at least minor details if not intermediate level understanding. That being said I do think you have to be able to look at a few good options and pick the best or most well suited.

Since you averaged 36 seconds per answer to the CISSP exam questions, many of which you acknowledged are insanely hard, as a hiring manager manager who‚Äôs had up to 50 IT staff direct reports at one time, this tells me a few things; 1. You‚Äôre a risk taker to blast through a $750 certification exam in that period of time 2. You ‚Äúgo with your instincts‚Äù, and make snap judgements, or guess an answer. I‚Äôve seen many cowboys crash and burn using that methodology 3. If you make decisions as quickly in real-life situations, which is so much more complex than that, then you‚Äôd be a risk to our organization. My guess is you take shortcuts, and aren‚Äôt process oriented, and that equals real financial risk. 4. Your co-workers might start emulating you, which is a bad example to follow 5. This is a CAT exam, it‚Äôs adaptive to the person sitting the exam, so as you advise people the ‚Äúthink like a manager‚Äù approach is overblown it means you don‚Äôt understand the test is different for everyone, and are prone to giving bad advice 6. What‚Äôs to be gained by completing a test in one third the allotted time, when it counts for nothing towards the final certification? This exemplifies a flawed ‚Äúrisk vs reward‚Äù mentality, and if you did this on a project, you‚Äôd probably do the bare minimum amount of work. 7. You may be yanking everyone‚Äôs chain, which shows a good prankster sense of humor, but might deflate the confidence of someone looking to take the test. This sucks, in my not so humble opinion, because I‚Äôm as vain or more so than the next person, but I wouldn‚Äôt do that to someone else 8. This might be an ego thing, and you‚Äôre a total bullshit artist; enough said 9. Finally, who gives a shit? Will anyone at work care, or was there a time specific bonus they‚Äôll pay for speed reading? If so, frame your certification, and hang it up in your cubicle with a Post-it note saying you completed it in an hour. That‚Äôs if ISC2 doesn‚Äôt flag you for using exam dumps and possible cheating, and decides to hold up your endorsement. 10. If you‚Äôre this intelligent, go out and cure cancer or do something more beneficial for society For those of you about to sit for the CISSP, take your time, and read each question twice. The majority of them have qualifiers that ask for the BEST, LEAST, MOST, INITIAL, solution, and if you skim read it once, you might miss that. I wasted five minutes writing this because I‚Äôm so sick of reading ridiculous time posted results; it‚Äôs like saying you sat at your desk for eight hours faster or better than anyone else, because the results are exactly the same. Until ISC2 starts sending out gold, silver, and bronze colored certifications based on how quickly a person passes the CISSP exam there‚Äôs no reason to care how long it takes to accomplish this career milestone.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord. In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake. If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

Having said that extreme caution is advised. If it's not a big name broker or involves sales people it's likely to be illegitimate. [Author: RomigWadah496, Score: -17, Posted: 1730982398.0] Exactly!
