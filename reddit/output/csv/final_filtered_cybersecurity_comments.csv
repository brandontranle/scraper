Googles AI Breakthrough in Cybersecurity serves as a warning,cyberkite1,cybersecurity,267,1730778709.0,56,"Google has unveiled a world-first innovation: AI discovering a zero-day vulnerability in widely-used software. Through a collaboration between Google’s Project Zero and DeepMind, the ""Big Sleep"" AI agent identified a memory safety flaw in SQLite, a popular database engine. This achievement is a milestone in cybersecurity, leveraging artificial intelligence for enhanced protection. The groundbreaking find underscores the power of AI when combined with skilled ethical hackers. Google’s Project Zero, known for hunting down critical vulnerabilities, and DeepMind's AI expertise are setting new standards with this large language model-driven agent. Big Sleep is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in preemptive security measures. Traditionally, fuzzing (injecting random data to uncover bugs) has been a key tool, but it has limitations. Big Sleep aims to overcome these by detecting complex vulnerabilities before software even reaches users. This could pave the way for AI to become an integral part of software testing, catching issues traditional methods miss. Although still experimental, Google’s Big Sleep points to a promising future. As AI tools evolve, they could streamline vulnerability management, making it faster and more cost-effective. With innovations like these, defenders may finally stay one step ahead in the cybersecurity race. I've kept saying this is going to happen and now Google has actually done it, programmed Al to discover zero-day vulnerabilities. This should be a warning because malicious security hackers will also be looking for 0-day vulnerabilities this way and a celebration because Al will help in finding those vulnerabilities. It creates a lot of questions for the future.

Landed My Dream Cybersecurity Internship at Goldman Sachs—How Can I Make the Most of It?,Due-Student946,cybersecurity,145,1730756247.0,39,"Hey everyone! I’m incredibly excited (and grateful!) to have landed a Cyber Engineer Intern position with Goldman Sachs for next summer. I'm currently a college junior and have a few cybersecurity internships under my belt, both on the technical and consulting sides. This internship is such a huge step for me, especially with the pay (over $40/hr!) and the potential to turn it into a full-time offer. I want to make the absolute most out of the next seven months so I can show up as my best self and crush it. Here’s my plan so far, but I’d love to hear any additional advice from those who’ve been in the industry or had similar experiences! Python: Planning to dive deeper into Python since I know it’s so versatile and widely used in cybersecurity. Sec+ Certification: I’m aiming to get my Security+ certification before summer, as I feel it’ll round out my foundational knowledge. What else would you recommend? Are there other languages, tools, or specific skills I should focus on? I want to go in fully prepared and show my commitment to learning and growing. Any advice for leaving a strong impression to increase my chances of a full-time return offer would be greatly appreciated!

"LDAP signing forced via gpo, but ldp application doesn't prompt for creds. ",Impossible-Chip8991,cybersecurity,1,1730759871.0,0,"Hi all, Wanted to start off by saying am not familiar much with LDAP. I just want to make sure LDAP signing is enforced. I've enforced it through GPO specifically the ""domain controller: LDAP server signing requirement"" and ""network security:LDAP client signing requirements"" set to Require Signing. This was proven to be pushed out via a Resultant Set of Policy tool report, but some pen testers report that ldap isnt forcing signing. Also, to test on the my side I've been using the default win11 LDP app, connecting to my domain controller server, to see if it prompts for a password or token of sorts. My first question is if this is the correct way to test if LDAP signing is turned on, or if those GPO's I mentioned are the ones I want. I also toyed with the one titled ""LDAP server channel binding token requirements"" and set to Always, but same result shows via the LDP app. Any help would be appreciated.",
USAA PHISHING SCAMS (Spoofing customer services #!),Wise-Hat9376,cybersecurity,1,1730757582.0,0,"Hey heroes! My wife nearly fell victim to a phishing scam. She texted her username after they pressured her, trying to get her password too. She came to me as I was clocking out from my job as a CIRT Analyst. I have to say, I love this field! She muted the guy on the call and asked if it was legit. First thing I asked was if he had an Indian accent—no offense, just part of my process of elimination. She said yes, so I got on the phone. The caller ID was spoofed, and the guy sounded somewhat professional. Right away, I told him that USAA wouldn’t ask for both username and password. He quickly said he felt uncomfortable talking to me and asked to speak to my wife again. I laughed, told him to stop scamming, and as I hung up, he yelled something profane—sealed the deal right there. We reported the attempt to USAA, changed her username and password, and they’ll be monitoring her account. Honestly, if I didn’t work in cybersecurity, we might have fallen for it—especially with a spoofed customer service number. Stay alert, everyone! Scammers are targeting hard-earned money, especially during the holidays. Spread the word!” USAA: Have you attempted a transaction in the amount of $328.59 at a Walmart Supercenter Fayetteville, AR?

Working Abroad - Nobody Has Said Anything,Wide_Curve8942,cybersecurity,67,1730658310.0,74,"Hi all, I would love to get a better understanding of how cybersecurity teams deal with resources pinging in other countries. Here is the background: I decided to travel to another country after a death in the family and stayed for 2 months. I called IT ahead of time and asked them if there would be issues with the country that I was going. They said “no, this country isn’t in the blocked list. You will be fine.” However, my boss’s doesn’t want people traveling abroad and working. Well, I was willing to lose my job over this and just went - I didn’t let my boss know either. It has been two months and no one has said anything. So… I guess I am just surprised that IT or cybersecurity didn’t reach out to ask: hey, is this you in X country?

Networking but HOW? ,CoolGuyLovesTech,cybersecurity,11,1730653295.0,21,"So, from my research the last months I concluded that in order to start your cybersecurity career (or your career in general) nowadays is much easier if you do it through a referral. That means personal network is the best option! It is clear and it is 100% understandable. But now the serious question, how do you really connect with people and create your personal network? For example, I am working as a Network Automation Engineer/Consulting Engineer(mix of careers in one position) for almost 3 years and I would like to do a transition to Cybersecurity. My job is 100% WFH and I haven't any face-to-face interactions,not even with my team. How am I supposed to create network under these conditions? Lets say I am trying through LinkedIn, I add 100 people and then what? I just send cringe,desperate messages about myself? Any ideas?

Certification Advice - Comptia Security+ (SY0-701)?,RoyBattyTheNexus,cybersecurity,1,1730679642.0,0,"Looking for some help from the community. I work for a pre-sales department for a large WW company. I do mostly pre-sales the products - discussions around security, how to integrate, security policies, secure protocols, cyphers, secure authentication, Kerberos, SAML, OIDC among other topics, also certificate management automation toolset integration for our products use (MSCEWS and SCEP mostly - I'll need to get into EST and ACME shortly) I actually actively do/assist in deployment too - but do not work support. Finally, due to past experience, I'm sometimes called upon to spend about 20% of my time in developing custom very specific solutions on top of our product - this is mostly java development. While I'm therefore nothing near a full time developer I do know my way around Java development in an OSGI context, as well as some of the steps of secure development from the user perspective only (Ex: SonarLint, SonarQube, Blackduck, etc). I was supposed to be done with this by now, but it keeps coming back at me from time to time - it is not my future. I'm not young anymore, but still have at least 15-17 years of work in front of me. Other than MS certifications from 10+ years ago I've done no formal training or certification, which I regret, but that's water over the bridge. No better time than right now to revert this and the company will make available some money for training - it's up to me to make suggestions and to improve the depth and scope of my knowledge, as well as start getting some confirmation of it. Goals: - Present a proposal to the company for training costs - that primarily values myself as an asset for the market for similar positions - but that makes me acquire further knowledge that relates to my current position - I have no intention of leaving, at least not for now and it needs to be fair to both parties - the proposal needs to be for self paced remote training - the company will not accept using work hours and family life obligations require this approach anyway I was thinking of the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701). Cost for Exam is aprox 400Eur & cost for online learn materials and training is approximately 500 Eur - so my proposal would be for 1000 Eur spend. Would ask the community for their experiences and suggestions: - Have you taken this course / exam before? - Does it have relevant recognition? - Is it worth it, or are there better alternatives under the context? Thank you to all for suggestions or comments!",
Cybersecurity researchers: Would a mobile-focused MITM tool with a built-in VPN setup and easy-to-use proxy UI be useful to you?,AdTemporary2475,cybersecurity,1,1730673301.0,0,"Hey all, I’m working on a MITM tool tailored for real-time mobile traffic analysis that might fill some gaps left by existing options like mitmproxy or Charles. Here’s the pitch: VPN-Based Setup: The tool works via a VPN configuration that includes an automatic certificate installation process, so there’s no need to be on the same local network as the target device. This makes setup easy, even for mobile testing on the go. MITM Proxy-Style UI: Users get access to a familiar proxy-style interface displaying all captured requests in real time, with filtering and sorting options. I’m interested in feedback from those who regularly use tools like mitmproxy or Burp. What features or pain points could this address? Would the VPN setup be valuable in your work? Thanks in advance for any insights!",
Seeking In-Depth Insights and Practical Guidance on Implementing Zero Trust Security (ZTS),JohenLiebert,cybersecurity,0,1730658575.0,1,"Hi everyone, I’m currently diving deep into the concept of Zero Trust Security (ZTS) to potentially apply it within our environment. I’d love to get practical advice and hear about your experiences on several specific aspects. Here are some questions I have in mind: 1. Adapting Zero Trust to Existing Infrastructures: I’ve read that implementing ZTS without disrupting ongoing operations can be challenging, especially in organizations with established infrastructures. What are some of the primary challenges you faced when integrating Zero Trust with an existing infrastructure? Are there specific phases or key steps you’d recommend to make this transition smoother? 2. Managing Permissions and Segmentation: Micro-segmentation is often highlighted as a core aspect of ZTS. What are some best practices for segmenting networks and setting access policies without creating management complexity? Have you found effective ways to balance security and ease of administration? 3. Mitigating Lateral Movement Risks: One of the goals of Zero Trust is to minimize the risk of lateral movement by potential attackers. What strategies or tools have you found most effective in detecting and preventing lateral movement within a Zero Trust framework? 4. Applying Zero Trust in Cloud Environments: Many companies now operate in multi-cloud or hybrid environments, which complicates policy enforcement. How have you handled the challenges of enforcing Zero Trust policies consistently across different cloud providers? Are there tools you’d recommend for orchestrating policies across hybrid environments? 5. Measuring the Effectiveness of a Zero Trust Strategy: As we implement ZTS, I want to ensure we’re setting the right metrics to assess its effectiveness. What metrics have you found most useful in evaluating the success of Zero Trust within your organization? How do you measure improvements in security posture over time? 6. Balancing Security with User Experience: Zero Trust often requires continuous authentication and verification, which can impact the user experience. How do you balance strong security protocols with minimizing friction for users? Have you had success with adaptive authentication or behavioral analysis to streamline access? 7. Budget and ROI Considerations: The costs associated with implementing ZTS—tools, training, and restructuring—can be significant. What are some approaches you’ve taken to quantify the ROI of Zero Trust, or to justify these investments to leadership? Any insights, tools, or resources you’d recommend would be greatly appreciated! If you have any practical examples of overcoming these challenges, I’d love to hear about them. Thanks in advance for your input!",throwmeoff sans sec course powershell implementing zero trust

CVE Scans in IoT/Automotive field - Backport Recognition,Bobaumeister,cybersecurity,1,1730652785.0,1,"Hi everyone, I'm currently working in the automotive domain where we are facing issues when it comes to proper CVE scanning of our firmware images. The issue is the following: We mostly receive a firmware ""blob"" from suppliers, for which we then can do CVE scans on our side (e.g. via Cybellum, JFrog XRay, ...). Unfortunately, those scanners mostly do version matching and in consequence deliver a large amount of false-positives. Why false-positives? Of course the suppliers perform backporting, so applying security patches of newer versions on to older versions of an application/library. This is exactly what e.g. Debian does, and what also some CVE scanners can recognize (but just based on version matching and an available backport list afaik). But in our case, we don't get a qualitative and trustful enough list of applied backports, so we are still stuck with false-positives. For us security guys this gets pretty time-consuming and frustrating to manually verify and filter out false-positives. Now I'm wondering if there are others (also from other sectors) out there which face similar issues and somehow solved it? Or are there more out there who face the same issue like us? As a sidequest, I'm thinking about investing some research time into automating patch presence detection in binaries, to (at least partially) reduce the manual effort. Happy to hear your opinions - thanks!",lawtechie seems like vendor management issue cant force suppliers give validated sbom component buy
