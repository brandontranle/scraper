URGENT - EU Chat Control - please send an email,nmp5,privacy,322,1725202469.0,28,"Click on the link of your country here (the blue link, not the ""+"" button): https://op.europa.eu/en/web/who-is-who/organization/-/organization/REPRES_PERM/REPRES_PERM And grab the email address there. -- Then, enter here: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home Select your country in the dropdown, and then it will present you with a number of people.

Just say that this goes against our rights to privacy, and may even be unconstitutional, and ask them to please vote against this law. Points I suggest including in the email: I agree with the need to prevent and combat child sexual abuse. I am concerned that the proposed rules imply constant surveillance of personal communications, such as messages and emails, using Artificial Intelligence directly on the device. I believe that this mass monitoring constitutes a violation of the right to privacy, which is guaranteed by the Constitution. The mandatory identification through ID cards may increase users' vulnerability to cyberattacks and data breaches. The use of AI to monitor communications could result in false positives, unjustly exposing private conversations of innocent people. I fear that real criminals will find ways to circumvent the surveillance, making these measures ineffective against those who should truly be caught. Meanwhile, innocent people, who do not try to evade these measures, may be unjustly exposed due to false positives. I urge the need to find a balance between protecting children and preserving citizens' fundamental rights. -- Remember... politicians will be exempt from this control. It's easy to create laws for the common people, but as long as they don't affect those who make the laws, everything's fine, right?...

How to find all Health Information Exchanges (HIE) and pharmacy exchanges used in Ohio? To opt-out of exchanging my health information.,Demolecularizing,privacy,6,1730833342.0,1,"Most people are not aware that we are automatically, without our explicit consent, enrolled in Healthcare Information Exchanges that allow any of our doctors to access some of our medical records from separate doctors. Multiple other states are automatically opt-ing states. A good post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/f6wvc5/how_to_exercise_your_right_to_optout_of_your/ I'm trying to track down all of the HIEs that are used in Ohio (and eventually federally) so I can work on opt-ing out. Privacy officers aren't always forthcoming even though they legally obligated to allow us to opt-out. The HIEs I'm finding from Google are only two. Clinisync and HealthBridge. None of my doctors use those HIEs; at least not under those names. One of my doctors use ""CareEverywhere"" but I wasn't able to find this HIE listed as used in Ohio. So, I think the information I'm finding on Google is incomplete since my doctors use HIEs that aren't listed anywhere. I haven't been able to find any type of list of pharmacy HIEs; like the ""SureScripts"" network. My doctor's privacy officers claim to be unaware of pharmacy HIEs. How can I find a more complete list of all HIEs used in Ohio?",omafietser operating us provider legally obliged give information hie part start
Best email for unlimited aliases?,margsntacos,privacy,2,1730843926.0,17,"I hope this is the right place to ask. I’m looking for an email service with unlimited aliases. I tried to figure this out around 5 years ago, but ended up not finding anything. I settled on making several different gmail accounts… one for personal contacts, one for social media accounts, one for shopping accounts, one for banking accounts, etc. Obviously gmail is not the best for privacy but my main goal was for hackers not to be able to get to all my accounts if something got compromised. For example, if my shopping gmail account gets hacked, at least my banking gmail account is still safe. Now I want to take it a step further and try to achieve my original goal. Ideally I’d have one email address that I never share with anyone, and I’d have an unlimited amount of aliases that I can use for each service. These aliases should last forever and never be reused if I cancel the service. This way, everything is in one place and I can quickly and easily see if something is compromised. Based on my research, I’m leaning toward getting a custom domain. It seems like every other option has drawbacks or doesn’t achieve what I want 100%. Am I missing any downsides to getting a custom domain for my email? Also, if I went that route, where would I host it and how would I make the unlimited aliases for it? To be clear, as much as I’m concerned about privacy, I’m more concerned about privacy from each service I sign up for. I’m not as concerned about privacy from my email provider. If that makes sense. If I can achieve both, great… but my main focus is being able to use an alias to hide my email from each service. I’m thinking about Start Mail with a custom domain. Can anyone recommend this? My concerns are: they don’t have an app which would be inconvenient. Also if Start Mail ever goes out of business, I’m guessing I’ll still have my main custom domain email… but where would all my aliases go? This is going to be a huge project. I think I have over 100 accounts and each account would have its own alias… so I would like to not have to do it all over again.",cortacircuit proton smallcantaloupe might consider trying year get unlimited aliases ive satisfied product margsntacos thanks looking website want sure understanding correctly theyre email provider right looks would work email address proton mail address id check email proton app one gmail addresses id still check email gmail sorry new want sure understanding right side note went custom domain email id find provider host use simple login tacitpin yes theyre forwarding service use whichever email provider want backend also add custom domain sl forwarded whichever provider want margsntacos thank helpful okangle may want use domain alias service premium addresses may blacklisted across internet gilluc mail service catchall feature solution guess owncustard prefer simplelogin even catchall rule addresses match rule get created avoid catchall spam lool ironvest still unlimited noncustomized email addresses free example theyll look lbfopayqcom domains depending service trying sign especially provider blocked one already want use domain ones specify may shell year ive sometimes paid mostly free duckco slightly newer entrant email game duckduckgo also good reputation id trust free service catchmygrift worth icloud offers unlimited aliases hidemyemail supposedly encrypted advanced data protection would require apple ecosystem really work margsntacos apple ecosystem wouldnt mind going route checks boxes correct wrong use hidemyemail create totally random alias right delete someone else could get assigned alias stopping going route could also completely wrong understanding ideally id able create alias something facebookmydomaincom keep track easier catchmygrift others getting assigned address least deactivated deleted may answer question hidemyemail gives unlimited random generated icloudcom addresses really customizable easy type sometimes works great passwords safari excellent elsewhere custom domain icloud sure aliases custom domain havent tried tbh look user email exempted advanced data protection apple ecosystem maintain compatibility third party clients uniquedefaultuser use meandmyidcom tutanotacom address adeptaddress different ways domains use complete throwaway addresses never reply host domains easydnscom feature called mailmaps free hosting lets create forwarding aliases including catchall mail domain domain use aliases want reply use simpleloginio accepting theres privacy risk since mail goes third party service never banking financial medical etc tetmohawk get domain use boltsteel impressed migadu email check asking

Looking for a ChatGPT alternative with better privacy,dc22_22,privacy,12,1730815854.0,49,"I’ve been using ChatGPT for over a year, and honestly, it’s been awesome.

I even use it to talk through personal stuff, like family issues, so the idea of that info not being secure is kinda unsettling. Anyone else feel the same way?

I'm using the Betterfox script to improve privacy and so far so good. My problem comes when I noticed that in my laptop Microsoft Edge performs a lot faster and lighter than Firefox. I usually avoid using Microsoft software because of my personal choices and privacy related things, but I can't deny that fact. So my plan is to continue using Firefox as always on my main machine and Edge on my laptop. I already use Bitwarden to manage my login info (I don't know if there's something similar regarding bookmarks) but the less depend on the browser the better. So I know there are some settings in the privacy tab, but I would like to know if there's more than one can do to improve privacy on Microsoft Edge regarding data collection/telemetry or unnecesary stuff running with it like we have on Firefox thanks to betterfox.",evoletah used edge work genuinely one best browsers edge default way many features enabled default first thing disable almost features features enabled install privacy badger unlock origin google chrome store also works edge since chromium based add dns proxies get work maybe disable javascript well heard useful also edge works faster windows opened start windows apps use edge backend cause pwa app progressive web application basically means webpage without browser stuff apps outlook copilot reddit tiktok mostly pwas edge also stronger integrations apps usually edge already launched feels faster wencekun thanks windows iotltsc loading faster sadly firefox video playback kfps shifting one task another way smoother firefox laptop struggles tasks didnt privacy badger going give shot already use ublock origin privacysexy must already taken care privacy settings going double check

So, I want to separate my passwords. Some of them are professional and rest of the others is personal. Currently, I store all my passwords in Bitwarden but need to separate those. My requirement is -- Same level of protection offer by Bitwarden or even better is good. Solid app support for android, desktop is not that much necessary. Must be privacy focused. Recent experiments -- KeePass -- Used KeePass2Android, it work well in my device but recently I came to know that KeePassDX is the only app which still gets update so deceided to shift to that. But KeePassDX is not working properly, I have stored multiple passwords of same website so I need the popup selection or manual selection, but sadly the app is not showing anything like that. There have option for separate keyboard and inline suggestion but I want the manual selection. Bitwarden -- Already using it, everything is good but one problem we can't create folders in mobile app. Also, I don't know how to make it more secure, using the default config. Someone help me in this also. 1Password -- Never use it because it has no free paln to try out. I don't like to take free trials. Although, I heard it has extra protection compare to Bitwarden. ProtonPass -- Due to their integration of all services, I don't want to use their products. Even, I like simplelogin and standard notes, I am finding alternatives. So, staying away from Proton.

Any way to impede cross-referencing data by a company,Senior_Squirrel_7355,privacy,3,1730749942.0,0,"Hello together, Im asking myself how I best prevent a company from beeing able to cross-reference data. Im looking to buy a Pico 4 Ultra VR Headset, as they have been bought by ByteDance privacy is obviously a concern. I also occasionally have to use tiktok on my phone, which is connected to the same network the glasses are going to connect to. Even though the required account for the vr glasses is not a tiktok account, I guess they are in some way trying to combine the data and link it to a person. If so, is there any way to prevent this? Would simply deleting tiktok from the phone that is connected to the same network, wait for a new IP in 24-36 hours and only then setup the glasses be enough? I guess not but maybe somebody can provide some guidance :) (Using a different email adress is ofc also already planned) The goal is not to completely prevent sending any data, just so that they cant both be linked to the same person. Thanks in advance!",

ChatGPT as responsive journal,drymeweald,privacy,6,1730732969.0,14,"Recently I had the thought of using AI as a journal that can remember and respond to things I wrote in the past.

It's useful if there's stuff you don't want to talk about with your friends, or if you have to rant and don't want to bother a real person with it. Yet, I'm concerned about the privacy. I have created a separate email account with Proton Mail, and I have nothing else on there. The rule is: don't write anything that you wouldn't be comfortable sharing in a blog. I'm considering writing some very private things though, is there a way that this could be traced back to my real life identity, through my device for example?

If applying to life insurance, and you reveal a sealed criminal record, and say... the insurance company is data breached, wouldn't this info then essentially become ""public"" (or at least dark web searchable). How realistic of a concern is this? Doing a search, there have been many insurance breached this year already. Are there any life insurance options where this privacy can be preserved, that may be still a reasonable deal (not the ripoff of 25k guaranteed issue)? This was asked in theory to a life insurance reddit and they seemed to think these background questions are inevitable especially when doing an app asking an underwriter to overlook things in general.

Podcast data collection and targeted ads,KapakUrku,privacy,1,1730732974.0,0,"I use Antenna Pod and see it get recommended as open source and with no analytics or data collection. Even so, I get targeted ads in my podcasts. For sure this is at least location-based (the name of my city is used in ads quite often) and I get that this will be about my IP address. But my impression is that it goes beyond this, even if the targeting seems to be inaccurate (e.g. I got a lot of ads targeted at small business owners recently, which I'm not, but which possibly you could think I was, based on recent purchase history). Even if it's just location-based targeting via the IP address, how are advertisers getting this info via an app with no data collection? Is to do with Google Play Services? Does it somehow happen via RSS feeds, independently of the app you use? I have an android phone which I've degoogled/debloated to some degree with ADB, but (unlike my other devices) I haven't yet got rid of Google Play Services as my banking app breaks without it (even with MicroG etc). Other than the obvious type of service (which I'm apparently not allowed to mention the name of) to hide the location- and short of custom ROMs or a new phone- is there anything more I can do here?",
Copilot has access to detailed rental application information,Immediate-Worry-1090,privacy,25,1730667462.0,19,"I just did a query on my name in ms copilot and it included a very specific line from a rental application I submitted a few weeks ago. I have never included that specific statement previously in any other documents. It was word for word accurate and I have no idea how this information would have found its way to copilot so quickly or even be allowed to access it. I am in Australia and was forced to use the 2apply site to submit my application. It is appalling that this information has been so quickly disseminated as I also had to upload sensitive financial information. What can I do about this? EDIT: I have worked for many companies in au that have the tightest controls on data in the country. I have also worked at dnb in au where the data was apparently sourced from as indicated by a notation in the copilot output. They pay for access to rental dbs, however this information is incredibly specific and had to be sourced from text input from the ‘about you’ section of the application process.

HP BIOS settings for maximum privacy and security.,GroundbreakingFly141,privacy,1,1730711213.0,0,"Hi there, I got a HP Notebook and I want to configure the BIOS/UEFI for maximum privacy and security. I want to run Windows 11 and im working at the IT-Sector, so I know most things. But I never had to do with BIOS settings. I know that HP isn't the best company, but I bought this Laptop second hand. I just try to minimize the attack surface. At the following settings im not sure what they do and if they can be disabled: BIOS Sure Start: ""Enhanced HP Firmware Runtime Intrusion Prevention and Detection"" ""enables monitoring of HP system Firmware executing out of main memory while the user OS is running."" As far as I could research, it is a Program that runs all the time in the background and checks for changes in the BIOS. Im really not sure if this is necessary, it just seems like something that doesnt happen. Never heard of a attack like this. And i feel like this is a security threat on its own - a software that runs all the time with Firmware level access, idk man just seems shady. ""Allow OPAL Hard Drive SID Authentication"" Idk what this is tbh. Absolute Persistence Module Current State; Activation Status: Inactive Absolute Persistence Module Permanent Disable: No I know that Absolute is a theft-protectiom that acts like a rootkit. But I couldnt find a way to permanently disable it. If someone knows how, i would be grateful. system management command (on) What is the ""System Management Command (SMC)""? When checked, allows authorized HP >service personnel in possession of the PC >to reset security settings in case of a >customer service event. For customers that require more BIOS >security, uncheck this to prevent this type >of HP service command. So just for tech support i assume, not remotely? Now a few settings where im not exactly sure what they do, even after searching. Should i turn them on or off?: HP Sure Recover (was on) DMA Protection (was on) Full encryption of main memory (dram) (was on) Does this affect performance? I only got this setting, because i have a ryzen pro cpu(i guess)? USB Type-C connector system software interface (ucsi) (was on) AMD DASH (was off) ! HP Application Driver (was on) Now this is interesting. I had a few HP processes running in the background of windows. I disabled and uninstalled these services via cmd. But after rebooting they reappeared. Has this something to do with this? sanitization Mode coundown timer (120 pre-sanitization mode countdown timer (3) What are these?

How private are our conversations on Character AI?,dandy-2902,privacy,0,1730727442.0,30,"I’ve been using Character AI a lot lately, and I’m curious about how private these chats really are. Here are some key concerns: No Encryption: Chats aren’t encrypted, so it’s like leaving an open notebook out. Staff Access: Character AI staff can access chats if needed for maintenance, which feels a bit invasive. Privacy Glitches: There was a bug where users’ chats showed up in others' conversations—imagine personal info appearing in a stranger’s chat. Character AI is fun, but maybe avoid sharing anything too personal. Does anyone know of other AI chat tools with stronger privacy?

Strategies for Better Privacy,data_cat,privacy,0,1730677949.0,6,"I’m in a similar position to the person in this post: Am I Too Late for Privacy I’ve been making partial attempts at protecting and/or trying to claw back my privacy for years using various services and strategies. Unfortunately, I always wind up frustrated because this solution doesn’t work with that solution or feeling like it’s all just sound and fury in the face of data brokers and services where there’s no way to opt out. I’ve probably made things worse at some points: Setting up a new email address but then using it in conjunction with my phone number; forwarding and replying errors that wound up connecting email address to each other. I know there’s no perfect strategy, but I would really appreciate some help to a) claw back some privacy and b) have better practices going forward. Phone number and physical address pose the biggest problems. You can’t exactly have one-off versions of those like with email. Specific questions in addition to the larger plea for help: Can I establish an online presence that allows me to meet and communicate with people without sacrificing all of my privacy? Is there a good (if imperfect) way to have an online me and an IRL me? I have a duck.com address with aliases for webforms, etc. But that doesn’t work for things where I have to send the first email. Are there alternatives to Hide My Email? I know the answer to this is almost certainly going to be no, but is there any way at all of making my long-time cell phone number at least semi-private again? This is partially about not having data brokers use it to track me and partially about getting it off of all the political (and other) text lists.",mattnjaxx send outbound duck emails format testattestcomtestduckcom test first works cbaltb considered osint scrub datacat please elaborate link reliable information stunningskill alternative duckcom simplelogin addyio allow initiating cold email ie sending new mail aliases prem tier though unlimited alias ala duckcom plus ability also send addyio prem cheaper sl prem proton prem sl prem came default want full control full portability aliases without tied locked provider get custom domain chigga many options personally proton since provide suite also use pc popos userfriendly ready go linux distro stock full disk encryption also planning switch pixel wit non stock os browser use librewolf since protect trackers ublock pre installed also start deleting old accounts might take needed want start new online identity delete google account keeping always better keep access site apps change email alias email proton offer feature free aliases remember use vpn proton also offers free basically good free one needwant hide searching

ultrasonic fingerprint sensor inscreen,animalincageibuilt,privacy,1,1730674557.0,3,"i can find nothing on the internet about privacy/security concerns regarding in-screen ultrasonic fingerprint sensors. sure wish more talked about it within academia, civil liberties orgs, etc. the companies using them on the latest phones now sure aren't inviting the convo to happen as there are no technical documents or even specific explanations about it. best i can find on how they even operate is that generally/vaguely...1 pixel turns off in the general area the screen is prompting the user to place their authorized finger on the screen when the sensor activates to capture grooves in the finger to perform the pattern matching with what is stored on the device. supposedly the ultrasonic sensor cannot detect past 5-10mm from the sensor (1-2mm is corning glass or whatever the device uses, often another 1-2mm is for the user-added screen protector). can't say im going to trust that any of the above is actually true. due to my threat model and desired comfort levels, i'd need to conclude the sensor can capture the entirety of the physical space around me, where i am within that space, the physical characteristics of who/what is around me, etc. there are INTENSE intelligence (all 1st and 2nd world govs) interests, law enforcement interests, and corporate interests as to why the design, ingestion of the captured data back to a repo, and analysis of the data would make perfect sense to have resulted with the exact hardware dilemma i'm concerned about here...working it backwards is about the best one can do when doing these sort of thought exercises. WHY SHOULD I CARE i can hear you ask...i'm sure most folks on this subreddit obscure their cameras in some way on their devices to ensure they aren't abused...well ultrasonic scanning is just about the same exact thing to try to prevent as the capability/value to a threat actor is matched equally. even if i had a degoogled phone and running 100% open source software, the device itself is rather untrustworthy to be around throughout the majority of one's day-to-day activities. nothing can change how the qualcom/mediatek/etc chips are black boxes with closed-source binaries/blobs that speak directly to the components such as the fingerprint sensor, cameras, mics, light sensor, etc...so there's no software solution for this hardware problem. i've spent the last 5 days scouring product marketing materials, user forums, and yt vid reviews to find a replacement phone when my current device shits the bed or i lose it or i drop it. every other device i've found is DEEPLY compromised in some other way so as to not be worthy to be a daily driver to depend on. whether its bootloader can't be relocked after flashing custom rom, won't work with US cell service providers, can't pass google safetynet basic for a couple of my required apps that i currently use fine with microg, can't confirm os compatibility before buying, always something... i guess with this post im hoping im wrong on something...maybe my search skills are lacking...maybe these custom rom teams know more than i've seen explained. overall, just really concerned about this trend and how no one seems to be thinking about this.",digitalchupacabra due threat model desired comfort levels id conclude sensor capture entirely physical space around within space physical characteristics whowhat around etc blunt threat model precludes smartphone animalincageibuilt looking solution previously stated looking solution id prefer discussion could lead increased awarenessinformationknowledgewide social acceptancechange digitalchupacabra ok ill bite increased awareness example poor one shows lack understanding use ultrasonic scanning unreliable rife interference smart phone already wifi decade point research showing use wifi claiming finger print scanners source threat model want bring awareness issue wild unsubstantiated claims way go
Am I too late for privacy?,Akagi2525,privacy,102,1730571770.0,45,"I have been using the products of large companies for many years (Google, Microsoft and more) I've been researching privacy for 2-3 months now. I want to change everything, but I feel like I'm too late. Companies have already learned all my knowledge and have been learning for years. What would change if I changed every program, system, phone I use? I feel like it doesn't matter anything. And in a lot of people I know, my photos in their Google photos. This bothers me. Even if I tell them to delete it, new ones will be added. And those pictures have been standing for years, and if they delete them, nothing will change. Also, it is very difficult to explain these things to the people around me. I have to use WhatsApp and Instagram to talk people. I don't know what to do. Thanks for your comments.

(Additional question since 13 pro max has Secure Enclave, is there truly any security benefits to upgrading to an iPhone 16 pro max or is it negligible?) Is that setup essentially hack proof by most standard law enforcement agencies ? Are there any security settings or things I should enable to further secure my device without making it too annoying to use day to day?",lugh comments single one mentioning lockdown mode antiprotonboy

Should I use Standard Note and Simple Login from privacy standpoint?,night_movers,privacy,1,1730640604.0,6,"Hey everyone, I have doubt regarding SimpleLogin and Standard Note. My plans for both of these services have recently expired so, asking for your suggestion before renewing my plan or if I should go with the alternative. Standard Note: Probably the most popular end to end encrypted privacy focused note taking app it is. Their main selling point is privacy. I used it for rich test, markdown features so I had to take the paid plan and back then it is the only option out there. But after the recent acquisition by Proton, I am bit doubtful about my privacy withthis app. I am not against Proton but somewhat I don't like to integrate my email provider and private note provider together, so need your suggestion in this. Currently, Notesnook may be the closet alternative here. Many people suggest it as a more secure option than Standard Note. Although, it is comparatively new app and I never try out. SimpleLogin: Most used email aliasing service out there, I saw it was used by many people in covid pandemic. I also used these service and I think it has more polished user interface than other competitors. But, it currently comes under Proton, I read SimpleLogin now operate on Proton's server. Also, it come nearly free of cost with Proto Unlimited plan. The only good alternative of it is Anonaddy. But the only difference is SimpleLogin filter out spam mails while Anonaddy don't.

Some questions about email,katarsiss_,privacy,0,1730626413.0,15,"Hello!! First of all, I'm new here and I don't know much about online privacy and some software, so I ask for a little patience. Second, English is not my native language, so I apologize if I write with a lot of mistakes. Most of my emails are from Google, so I don't know if it's worth changing all of them to other providers (like MailBox/Proton). Although I don't value privacy so much in some of them, I definitely want more privacy in others. If it's not worth making all of them private, should I create an email from a more private provider to use for password recovery? Or does that even make sense? Does having a more private email provider make me need to use an email client like FairEmail? What exactly is the purpose of this type of software?

Signal vs WhatsApp vs Telegram: which one is best for privacy?,xDeluxers,privacy,0,1730636487.0,55,"Hi everyone, I’m trying to figure out which messaging app is the best in terms of privacy. I know Signal is probably the most secure, but I’d like to understand the main differences compared to WhatsApp and Telegram, especially regarding metadata collection and sharing with other platforms. I know that WhatsApp collects certain metadata (like when you’re online, who you chat with, etc…) and shares it within the Meta ecosystem to build your profile. This worries me because I’m not sure how much is actually shared and how well my privacy is respected. As for Telegram, I know that only secret chats are end-to-end encrypted (E2E), so I’d only use those. But I’m unclear about what metadata Telegram collects and how it uses it, especially in non-encrypted chats.

Should I create a new email address as an adult?,Unhelpful_,privacy,25,1730504844.0,34,"I am 18 almost 19, and most of my accounts are spread across two or three different emails. Other than the basic email needs, I've used them to create plenty of accounts on random sites I used maybe once when I was a kid, usually for gaming. Most of these random accounts have reused passwords as well. I've already started the process of changing all of my passwords and keeping them in someplace safe that I can refer to if needed, but I have also been thinking about just making a new email altogether. I know making the new email address is simple enough, but changing all the old accounts or making new ones could be a problem, especially for accounts I've had for years. Can somebody more knowledgeable tell me if this is a good idea, and if so, the best way I can go about it? I'm doing it mainly for privacy and organization purposes, as I'd like to have every account under one email that I have been keeping close track of.",responsiblepair yes worth go delete old emails
