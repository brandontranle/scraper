Passed OSCP+ on first attempt! (70/110pts),twixter07,oscp,74,1731035736.0,14,"This was the wildest roller coaster of a test I’ve ever taken. I just got the email that I passed today. It took about 44 hours to hear back after submitting the report whether I passed or not. Someone on here said to check the “exam” tab in your PEN-200 dashboard because they show if you pass there sooner than they email and this was actually true for me. I purchased the learn one year subscription about 11 months ago and honestly, I did not lock in my studying until about 3 months before. This was a mistake as I could have gotten a lot more practice and been more prepared. For labs I ended up only doing OSCP A B C (some hints were needed) and Secura, and like 3 PG machines. This was also likely a mistake. I did not do a practice report for OSCP A B C or treat them like mock exams. I just used the OffSec template for the real report. I had some experience with pen testing knowledge and tools from my GPEN certification and some very inconsistent HTB usage a long time ago. I’ve also watched a TON of ippsec videos. I think this alone is why I was able to get away with such little lab practice. I had a pretty solid baseline which helped a lot. Most of the PEN-200 material I was already familiar with, and I only ended up completing 50% of the course. Thats not to say it was not valuable however. This is my first OSCP attempt so I don’t know about the old AD, but this new AD with partial points was my life saver. I would not have passed without this change. Here’s a rough timeline of my experience: 4PM: Started the exam, got my VPN files and dashboard and such. I had some trouble figuring out how to share both my screens with the proctor so in reality I probably started at like 4:15PM. Make sure you log in 15 minutes early at least. 6:15PM: By around 6ish I had already obtained 2 local proof.txts from the AD, securing 20 points. I was feeling great. All that was left was the domain admin. 6:30PM-01:00AM: The despair kicks in. I had been spinning my wheels for so long on the last part of the AD. When I would spend too much time stuck on the final AD machine I would go do a little bit of work here and there on the standalones. I felt pretty defeated because I went this whole 7 hours pretty much making 0 progress not even getting a foothold on any standalones. I ended up going to bed being sure I was about to fail. 7:30AM: Woke up and ate a protein bar, then started back up again. I was 99% sure I had figured out the path for this standalone the night before but could not get it to work. I tried it again in the morning and it just worked magically. Not sure what happened here. The privesc came a few hours after and only worked after about my third try. Lesson here is don’t give up if it doesn’t work the first time. Research backups to your exploits/tools incase one of them fails you can confirm it’s not a fluke with another version. ~11:30AM: Started working on the second standalone. Due to good enumeration I figured out the foothold quite quickly. Manual enumeration is and always will be key. Got stuck in a rabbit whole for a while but finally got the privesc. ~1:30PM: I had about 2 hours left and realized I only needed one more flag. I was freaking out internally because I didn’t think I could actually do this. I never went back to the last AD machine and instead focused on the final standalone that I had been putting off. I was so lost and so nervous and didn’t have much time. I eventually found it and realized it was so much simpler than I was making it. And by golly what do you know, I had enough flags for 70 points by about 3pm, with one hour remaining. Huzzah. 3PM-4PM: Used the last hour to frantically make sure I screenshotted EVERYTHING and did NOT mess up my proof.txt/local.txt screenshots. PLEASE double check your screenshots because I went back through and realized I did not capture the local.txt in one of my screenshots and only the ipconfig. Imagine if I had failed because of that. My score was as follows: 2 AD Proof.txt: 20 points 3 Stanadlone Local.txt: 30 points 2 Standalone Proof.txt: 20 points Total: 70 points Here’s a list of some resources that came in super handy during my prep and during the exam: ippsec.rocks website - anytime I needed to remember how to do something specific or saw a technology/platform I wasn’t familiar with, I just went on over to ippsec.rocks and typed it in, often times he was extremely helpful. It’s quite likely you’ll spend a lot of time googling/researching during the exam and ippsec can save a lot of time when you see something you’re unfamiliar with. It’s no secret this guy is a legend. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT08J44ErMmb9qaEeTYl5diQW6jWVHCR2&si=IgWyM3CLy9F6z4Kv - I watched this guy’s 3 OSCP Active Directory attack paths religiously the weeks before my exam. Definitely watch these and take notes. Follow along with his setup tutorial and set up the lab for yourself if you’re up to it. Incredible resource imo. https://eins.li/posts/oscp-secret-sauce/ - I saw someone else recommend this resource here and wow, the small tips and tricks here go a long way. Particularly the busybox reverse shell being so consistent and the Mimikatz one liner are super useful and just small things that make life easier/save time. https://github.com/crazywifi/Enable-RDP-One-Liner-CMD - Any time I needed to enable RDP on a box I had this up. Don’t forget you can use RDP. It makes life a lot easier/quicker when interacting with your target and can establish persistence. It’s not like it’s a real engagement so who cares, definitely use this if it makes your life easier. https://www.revshells.com - Amazing site I wish I’d known about sooner honestly. Easily and quickly generate reverse shell one liners in just about any format imaginable. During my practice the most consistent for me on windows was the powershell base64 one and the busybox netcat for Linux. Final advice: SCREENSHOT EVERYTHING! If it’s a command you ran to exploit something just screenshot it. You can always decide what is and isn’t needed after you start the report. But once that exam portion is over there’s no going back to get new screenshots, your lab access is ripped away. So make sure you got what you need before that 24 hours is up. Screenshot every exploit output and step along the way. I used CherryTree for my notes and had a section under each machine where I just spammed screenshots, and during my report I would pick and choose which ones I needed. Remember that everything is designed to be quite trivial to exploit. Don’t overcomplicate things. The answer is usually simpler than you think.

Received a disturbing ‘pickup duty’ text claiming they know my location—anyone else?,Fast-Thought-7670,Scams,2103,1730958272.0,62,"Hi everyone, I got a really disturbing text from a local area code that said, ‘Hello, you have been selected for pickup. We will come by at 12:00 Thursday. Don’t try to run—we know where you live.’ It’s unsettling because it came from my area code, and one of my friends got a similar text from a different area code with the same message about being picked up. Is this some sort of prank or scam going around? Any advice on how to handle this or reassurance would be really appreciated.

While studying, I kept coming back here for the best recommendations. This is the best community I’ve ever been a part of. I used these resources: Official Study Guide (9th ed.) Official Practice Tests (3rd ed.) Learnzapp. I believe that studying with just two books is sufficient (even though the editions were previous versions, they were very helpful in my preparation), I also practiced with Learnzapp whenever I had a chance. I studied for 6 months—2 hours per day for the first 4 months, and 3 hours per day during the last 2 months. I hope my experience proves useful to others preparing for the exam.

GRC or Cloud Engineer Summer Intern,biinks_,SecurityCareerAdvice,8,1731027179.0,10,"Hey ya'll. I'm a junior MIS major and internship season has blessed me with 2 offers from the same fortune 50 non tech company, in either an IT GRC Analyst or a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer role and I'm not sure which one I want to go with as they both sound appealing in different ways. They are both out of the Enterprise Technology department and pay the same amount, but from looking at glassdoor, their Infra Engineers make a good 15-20k more starting FT. I currently have a part time sysadmin internship at a small consulting firm where I work a little bit with AWS and I'm comfortable writing scripts and small applications in a couple different languages, but I feel like I'm under qualified for the Cloud Engineer position but that could be imposter syndrome speaking. I don't love programming and I know that I would likely be doing a lot of that, along with dealing with IAC which I haven't used before. I think it would be a good learning experience but I feel like I would be super out of my depth. The GRC Analyst seems like the safer option. I know they have good WLB in their careers which is something I care a lot about, and while starting comp is lower, I know that their pay can increase quickly. I also felt like I jived a lot more with the GRC team than the Engineering team but that doesn't matter too much. I think I could convince myself that the subject matter is interesting and I wouldn't have to worry as much about imposter syndrome. I think I am leaning towards the Cloud Infrastructure Engineer because I figure it's easier for a technical person to move to a less technical role vs a less technical person to move to a technical role. I'm really just trying to see what I would enjoy in my future career. Any input would be appreciated. I'd love to hear about people's experience in both spaces!

I'm not very tech savvy so excuse my ignorance. I've been concerned about malware for some time.

"Morning Brief 11/7 - California Wildfire Destroys Dozens of Homes, Israel Passes Law to Deport Families of Palestinian Attackers",AlertMedia,IntelligenceNews,8,1730990219.0,0,"California Wildfire Destroys Dozens of Homes: Powerful winds in California fueled a fast-moving wildfire on Wednesday, destroying dozens of homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. The Mountain Fire, northwest of Los Angeles near Camarillo, led to evacuations for over 10,000 people and threatened 3,500 structures in nearby communities and farmland. Federal aid was approved after Governor Newsom requested assistance. The fire expanded rapidly, covering 16 square miles within hours, while thick smoke blanketed neighborhoods and hindered visibility for firefighters and residents. As of this morning, the fire is at 14,187 acres and a red flag warning will remain in effect until 6 pm. Winds are forecast to strengthen through midday before steadily easing into the overnight. Hurricane Rafael Causes Power Grid Failure in Cuba: Hurricane Rafael struck Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane on Wednesday, causing severe damage before weakening to Category 2 and entering the Gulf of Mexico. Conditions in Western Cuba were expected to improve overnight as winds, rain, and storm surge subsided. However, the storm caused a power grid failure across the island. Rafael is the fifth major Atlantic hurricane of the year and the strongest to hit this late in the season since 2020. Israel Passes Law to Deport Families of Palestinian Attackers: Israel’s parliament passed a law today allowing the deportation of family members of Palestinian attackers—including Israeli citizens—to Gaza or other areas. The law passed by a 61-41 vote and is expected to face legal challenges. It targets Palestinian citizens of Israel and East Jerusalem residents who either knew about or supported relatives' involvement in attacks. Under the law, deported individuals could be sent to Gaza or elsewhere for 7 to 20 years. Israeli Airstrikes Kill at Least 40 in Lebanon: Israeli strikes across Lebanon killed at least 40 people on Wednesday, with targets reportedly including Hezbollah operatives in Baalbek and Bekaa. One strike damaged a historic Ottoman-era building near Baalbek’s Roman ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Additional strikes hit Southern Beirut, where Israel targeted Hezbollah command centers, weapons storage, and other infrastructure. The IDF issued evacuation warnings for multiple neighborhoods in Southern Beirut, including areas near Lebanon’s international airport, which remains operational despite the strikes. Germany's Chancellor Fires Finance Minister: Germany's governing coalition collapsed after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed Finance Minister Christian Lindner, citing a lack of trust between the two leaders. Lindner’s removal disrupts the coalition between Scholz’s Social Democrats, the Greens, and Lindner’s Free Democrats. This leaves the government without a parliamentary majority. Scholz announced plans for a confidence vote early next year, which, if unsuccessful, could trigger early elections by March. The political crisis comes as Germany faces economic stagnation and increased defense spending due to the war in Ukraine, as well as uncertainty following Donald Trump's election victory in the US that has raised concerns about the future of Europe's economy and security.",

Does this now apply to ALL wired ports on the network? TBH, outside of the DOD, I have yet to see an environment where wired port access is 802.1x controlled. Which means if the site is deploying a desktop on that port, especially a domain joined Windows computers, it might get tricky. On the wireless side the site is 802.1x. But not on the wired side.

Efficient performance for managing secrets and low-latency access. Reasonable operational overhead (my team has limited resources to manage very complex environments). I’m curious to hear from those with experience in deploying Vault in real-world scenarios. Specifically: Have you deployed Vault in bare-metal HA mode? If so, what were your experiences with redundancy and scalability? How did deploying Vault on a K3s cluster work out for you, especially in terms of performance and scaling? Are there other options you would recommend based on your past deployments? Any insights, lessons learned, or even gotchas that you ran into during deployment would be extremely helpful.

Supershy.,VomisaCaasi,europrivacy,13,1730562507.0,6,"As the state here in Estonia is growing more and more repressive by sacrificing basic human rights of its citizens in the name of ""speed and efficiency"" (I vaguely remember hearing about regimes like that from the past, it never ends well), breaking privacy laws set by its own courts (and by the EU) through surveilling, storing and possibly modifying all online communications while having zero oversight on who has access collected data or how all of it is being used, then I thought I would give my best on how to alleviate the pain its causing and will keep causing unless something is being done against it. Hence, I've spent the past month on developing a poor-mans VPN (read: SSH tunnel proxy) to make interception as well tampering of communications as hard as possible for any malicious party. It works by renewing exit nodes (and thus your external IPs) almost as often as you would like (with the minimum of interval of 2 minutes) by creating a new VPS for every connection. Technically, it's a DIY TOR, but with decent internet speeds. It's currently in a very basic state, no UI, no comforts, uses Digital Ocean API under the hood to create VPS's, but works well enough to already yield comments such as ""a three letter agency would like to have a word"". My next steps involve extending the provider set and eventually creating a non-profit organization (as to minimize the risks of greed taking over) for managing it. If you think you would like to either contribute or support it, then try it out, give feedback and/or create pull requests with improvements.

Anti-Forensics for Android on XDA,IVKIK55,antiforensics,13,1730223088.0,4,"I was browsing XDA forums and came across this app- It's free, open-source, and designed to protect sensitive data from any kind of pressure that might force you to unlock your device. Thought it might be helpful for you. Apparently, the dev was inspired by another app called Wasted by x13a, which could factory reset a device under duress using triggers like a special password or USB connection. While that’s great, factory resets can be obvious and risky if the person holding your device realizes what's going on. This app takes it up a notch by discreetly wiping data within a specific user profile, then uninstalling or hiding itself so it leaves as few traces as possible. You can set it up to wipe data if a duress password is entered on the lock screen, if a USB device connects without approval, or after repeated failed password attempts. There are some other features available: disabling logs to hide apps actions, disabling safe boot mode and running TRIM after data destruction. App has versions disguised as other apps to make detection of it traces in system harder. Looks interesting for me, though I'm not sure to what extent renaming package will protect against finding traces of app activity on device. Also app requires root rights for most advanced functions and you must use ADB to install it. You can check it out on GitHub for the full rundown. I'd also be happy for any comments on it, specifically about its trustworthiness",artemisarrow looks interesting ill check thanks explorerintrepid easiest way download ivkik well least yeah

AT&T data breach (discovered 23Aug24),Proud_Culture2687,databreach,10,1724454064.0,2,"Discovered today. Evidence points conclusively to AT&T having a second, very recent, data breach. Since they took 3 months to report the April one, and I personally had financial trouble from that, I'm posting this here for public information. How I found out: I have Cricket Wireless, which is owned by AT&T. I have multiple checking accounts, and earlier this summer, one of the accounts' debit card was used for fraudulent online purchasing (hundreds of dollars of MLM perfume). The debit card was cancelled and re-issued, and I only updated the card information with Cricket. The new card has not left my filebox, and has not been used for anything but Cricket autopay for my cheap cell phone. Today, I got a call from VISA asking if I had used that card this month for Cricket (yes) and some online clothing store I have never heard of (hell no). The data is only in one place-- Cricket, aka AT&T-- and has been breached in the two months since I got the new card. Ergo, AT&T has *another* data breach, one that happened in the last 2 months.",runtcip yep leak exposed addresses old landline also suspect voting activism platforms used services signed junk mails

Steps I took right after I notices I fucked up: Pull ethernet from my PC Change my Discord PW via phone app & removed all authorized apps Through a second PC I changed PWs for my nextcloud user and admin access and downloaded my shared Keepass database Changed master password on said database as well as every important account I could think of (paypal, emails, banking etc.) Deleted all partitions with a ubuntu boot stick through gParted and created new ones as NTFS Now waiting on the media creation tool for a fresh install.

This has been going on for as long as AI technology has become popular. Google refuses to handle or even provide any kind of insights or updates on the situation, thousands of reports have been made and left completely unanswered. The videos being reported remain active, misleading people into believing that the US government has provided a subsidy or stimulus, lying about investments, or claiming there is some kind of free grocery money.

Right now I do mainly AppSec and have some exposure in CloudSec, and I’m finding CloudSec quite interesting. I’d be interested in things on the automation side as well (did an internship in a DevOps role before), so something like DevSecOps sounds interesting, but from what I’ve seen it’s mainly focused on automation and less security. My goal is something in Silicon Valley where I’d be engaged but also be able to maintain a passable wlb. Any opinions on what and how to work towards those niches would be appreciated, thanks!

I'm a sextortion victim (M20),X3rthus_15,Sextortion,3,1731032410.0,8,So I was on tinder just swiping when suddenly I got matched with someone and she wanted to switch to telegram and I agreed. I'll admit that I was skeptical at first but for some reason her words seemed legit so I fall for it she called and turns out it's a guy and he screenshoted and screen recorded my face and my ykw as well as my Facebook profile. He initially asked for money it's kind of a little amount so I sent him (which I shouldn't) and he deleted the videos. But the screenshots costs another $50 to delete in which I did pay again ( I'm genuinely dumbfounded by my mistake). He deleted the photos after the payment has been made. However my only worry is for him to have backed up the photos and videos of me and post it. Reading this sub helped me. I already changed my name in my Facebook account and deleted my telegram.

It's unlikely that you'd want your family, colleagues, or contacts to watch the videos you're enjoying. Especially if it's your favorite genre.

Scam or genuine good intention Bug Bounty Report?,hotrodguru,bugbounty,5,1730993445.0,9,"I'm a full time photographer but also pretty versed in Wordpress and have built many sites. I know my servers PHP info is easy to access on my shared hosting plan. So I received the following email about PHP Info Exposure on my site. Something to worry about or someone just fishing for some money for something that isn't an issue? EMAIL: Hello, I hope this email finds you well. My name is Ali Adam, and I am a bug hunter and security researcher. In my spare time, I seek out vulnerabilities on websites to help improve their security while also earning a living. Recently, I discovered and reported a potential issue on your website through Open Bug Bounty. However, I suspect that you may not have received the notification due to some delays on their servers. Therefore, I wanted to reach out directly via email to ensure you have all the details of the bug report. Title of Bug: PHP Info Exposure on jaymarroquin.com Overview: During a bug bounty hunting session, a PHP Info page was discovered on jaymarroquin.com. This page exposes sensitive configuration details about the server's PHP environment, which can be leveraged by attackers to perform targeted attacks, such as exploiting known vulnerabilities, identifying installed extensions, and gathering information about the server's file system. Vulnerability Details: Affected URL: https://jaymarroquin.com/phpinfo.php Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure Description: The file PhpInfo on the jaymarroquin.com domain contains a call to the phpinfo() function, which outputs detailed information about the PHP environment. This information includes the PHP version, server details, loaded extensions, environment variables, and more. An attacker can use this data to identify weaknesses in the server configuration and potentially craft specific attacks against the server. Steps to Reproduce: 1- Open a web browser and navigate to the following URL: https://jaymarroquin.com/phpinfo.php 2- The PHP Info page will be displayed, revealing detailed configuration and environment information about the server. Impact: Server Fingerprinting:Attackers can fingerprint the server based on the disclosed PHP version, server software, and installed modules, allowing them to identify specific vulnerabilities to exploit. Sensitive Information Disclosure: The output may include sensitive information such as environment variables, file paths, and configuration settings that could be used to further compromise the server. Targeted Attacks: With the detailed information provided by the PHP Info page, attackers can perform targeted attacks against known vulnerabilities in the disclosed PHP version or installed extensions. Recommendation for Mitigation: Remove or Restrict Access to PHPInfo Pages: Immediately remove the PhpInfo file or restrict access to the PHP Info page by limiting it to authorized personnel only. This can be achieved by using access control mechanisms such as IP whitelisting or password protection. Regularly Audit Server Files: Conduct regular audits of server files to ensure that sensitive files like PHP Info pages are not publicly accessible. Keep PHP and Extensions Updated: Ensure that PHP and all installed extensions are regularly updated to the latest versions to mitigate the risk of known vulnerabilities being exploited. Minimize Information Disclosure: Configure the PHP environment to minimize information disclosure by disabling expose_php, setting display_errors to Off, and ensuring that sensitive information is not included in the output. I do this work to alert you to potential security issues on your website, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could consider providing a bounty for the bug I discovered. Such rewards motivate me to continue hunting for vulnerabilities and helping to secure websites like yours. If possible, I would be grateful if you could send the reward to my PayPal account: alihunter.adam@gmail.com Additionally, I am happy to create an invoice for the transfer if that is more convenient for you. I look forward to working together to enhance the security of your company's websites. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Tethering Problem,Fenixsz,VPN,2,1731029774.0,0,"Hey guys, so the problem i am facing is, recently as my phone got broken i am using a temporary one (A03 Core) only for daily basis use. One of my usual things to do is tethering my connection to the PC and using the internet through an app called HTTP Injector, that uses a vpn to make my internet work even when im out of data. The thing is, after i connect any device to my tether the internet don't work at all, only on my phone it works normal. Searching a little through the internet i found some people saying that VPN's don't work through tethering without the phone being rooted. The odd thing is, the phone IS INDEED ROOTED, but still it doesn't work. Also on my other phone (Xiaomi Redmi Note 7) it worked fine at the same conditions. Some other also said something about routing table, having custom rom to bypass that etc. but my knowledge into this is very low. So if anyone know about that app or what could be done to make the vpn work through the tethering i would really appreciate it.",

My mom refuses to believe this job is a scam ,Opposite_Magician_81,Scams,81,1730997996.0,60,"I’m hate to be so pessimistic, but this job sounds too good to be true. Oh and the Job in question pays $30 an hour and she was only interviewed through Microsoft teams 🙃 awesome righttttt? NO Only reason she’s not suspicious is because they never asked her for any personal information. It triggers my anxiety BAD that she won’t listen. and it hurts that they never listen. (It would’ve hurt even more if I didn’t say anything, but I’ve tried) The people who fall into these scams are so stubborn. I’m aware they don’t even have to always ask for that info. They just need you to take care of that check. I religiously watch catfish on yt (not the one from MTV), and am familiar with the signs/types of scams. I tried to tell her that it might be a scam, but she won’t listen. She’s waiting for the check to be deposited into her bank right now to buy the equipment. I forgot the amt. It was either around 12k or 9k. *It was 3k (Still a lot but thank GOD it wasn’t more) That amount was just her limit I’ve been searching other posts and recommended that she calls them. She refused, because she’s scheduled to speak with a “supervisor” soon. She said if anything happens the authorities will have the messages, and the bank will refuse the check. I’m just hoping to GOD they refuse it or she’s a soon to be victim of a scam. Im not sure why she doesn’t understand that the money she’ll lose…would probably be hard asf to get back. UPDATE (and it’s not a good one): Welp. She didn’t believe me. She didn’t check with the bank first. She put that check in. I told her not to several times. I was added onto her account back when I was a teen. I should’ve followed my intuition back made a separate account when I turned 18. I’m so stupid. I hear her checking in with her bank. Her bank is closing her account. I’m currently at work, and I see she texts me to log in to my account. I log in, and my account is in the negative hundred thousands. (I talked to the fraud dept. and they lmk it only appears that way because it’s on hold) I freaked tf out. I was at work and was unable to speak otp, and am currently taking a long break. I am in literal tears, and pissed off. I can create another account myself, but my savings? Apparently I can deposit my money it. I think I might need to go back to therapy after this. I can’t even describe how I’m feeling. She was so stubborn. Why? Ntm I was supposed to get paid tomorrow. Fml I guess. Also wanted to thank everyone for their insight and advice. I appreciate it.",uoppositemagician message posted new submissions rscams please message new users beware posted start getting private messages saying professional hacker recovery expert lawyer help

I am looking for help in choosing solutions ,Mrakafa,cybersecurity_help,1,1731027289.0,3,"Hello. I am looking for a solution similar to nextdns, zabbix, pcapdroid, wireshark. All in one. Some platform for a regular user through which I will redirect all traffic from my phone. I would like to be able to control everything that comes out of Android. Analyze. Block. Firewall with analysis... Often some websites do not work for me and I would like to know why. I have some suspicions that I want to check. When I was looking for information about updates for my Samsung, I could not enter the Samsung website on any browser. When I was looking for the BIOS for MSI, the MSI website did not work for me. I would prefer a solution without the participation of my laptop, i.e. a VPN on my system is out. Only external solutions. Is there something like that? Can you recommend something? It can also be paid. The nextdns website is not enough for me... Often I can't use the Google search engine because I get a notification that I've been blocked for sending too many DNS queries. Sometimes I can do Captcha until I die. I hope someone will help me.

Trying to make sense of TryHackMe solution for tcpdump arp question,change_for_better,HowToHack,2,1731039160.0,2,"Hello! Total newbie here (just started last week after taking some PTO) and first time poster in this sub. Please lemme know if I'm breaking rules or would be better served by posting somewhere else. As far as I know, this is the place for these beginner sorts of questions. Alright! So I'm in the Tcpdump: The Basics room on TryHackMe, and I was trying to sort out a solution to the following question: ""What is the IP address of the host that asked for the MAC address of 192.168.124.137?"" I answered the question in what I think is a brutish (normal for me) way by using tcpdump -n -r traffic.pcap arp | grep 'who-has 192.168.124.137 tell *' and got the answer right, but first I was looking at other folks' solutions and saw multiple workups (think I'm using that term right) using tcpdump -r traffic.pcap arp and 'arp[24:4] = 0xc0a87c89' where they converted the IP 192.168.124.137 to hexadecimal c0a87c89. I'm confused about the arp[24:4] and the 0x at the start of the hexadecimal. Could someone explain that and/or (better yet) provide some link to where I can learn more about how to use tcpdump with arp in this way or, if it seems appropriate, where I can learn more about how arp works? I've done some googling and looked at activedirectorytools.net/arp-command , users.softlab.ntua.gr/\~sivann/books/tcp-ip-illustrated/arp_addr.htm, geeksforgeeks.org/arp-in-wireshark, and linuxconfig.org/how-to-use-tcpdump-command-on-linux, but none of them seems to have an explanation for this arp[24:4] bit or the '0x' at the beginning of the hexadecimal representation of the IP address. (I also went back to the networking essentials room on tryhackme and couldn't find anything informative there for the ARP stuff above.) Thanks for any help you can provide! :)",ewka x tells read hexadecimal everything read x hexadecimal notation correct essentially thing wrote initial command based around bytes arp packet little sophisticated something dig future get hung changeforbetter oh cool thanks helpful takeaway x leadup hexadecimals foreshadowing future learning arp packets

"Trying to sell a ukelele on Facebook Marketplace, apparently I need to give my email?",invisible_limb,Scams,6,1731046210.0,18,"Image Details: Begins with buyer sending a screenshot asking for an email to send money over Venmo. Buyer says: what’s your email on Venmo so I can continue the payment? Me: Venmo doesn’t normally ask for that. Give me a second please Buyer: I had my Venmo account setup under a business user account and I only have my business email linked with it so I can only send payments on it with the recipient email Me: I hope you can understand my hesitation to give my email. It’s a very common Facebook marketplace scam to ask for an email while paying with Venmo Buyer: No it’s not Situation Details: The situation starts with him commenting on a post of mine from 2018 saying, “Hello,I’m interested in the Professional Ukelele $175 you listed on Facebook Marketplace! Sorry for commenting on your post, unfortunately my facebook has been acting up, so could you please send me a direct message on Facebook Messenger if it is still available? Thank you.” This immediately gave me a weird feeling but I messaged him. He then asked to pay for it before he received the item so I could “consider it sold.” Then the messages in the screenshot is what happened next. Afterwards we decided to meet but he would need to pay in cash. He seemed okay with that but I’m not sure he’ll actually show. (Because he didn’t message through marketplace, I can’t see how old is account it.

Nearly Fell for Jury Duty Phone Scam,KaiWenXiao,Scams,27,1731012499.0,24,"So sorry for how lengthy this is.... I feel like a fool but here's my story from today. Please keep in mind that I know absolutely nothing about law enforcement processes... I was at work and got a phone call from my local area code, I missed it and they left a voicemail saying ""this is officer _____ from the ____ police department. If you would please give me a call back as soon as possible."" so I called back spoke to the officer. He had a deep southern accent, spoke like an officer would speak too, it was extremely convincing. He told me that I had a warrant for my arrest due to missing jury duty. I had a little laugh about it because I didn't think it was that big of a deal and told him how that sucks cause I've always wanted to have jury duty (not even joking.) I explained to him that there was about 3 week span last month where I did not receive any mail, which is true. For about 3 weeks in October I didn't receive a single letter, not even coupons. I went and spoke to the post office about it and then the next day I started receiving mail again, so something was going on there. Anyway he said okay I understand, well what we are going to have you do is fill out these forms and give your statement. He then told me to come down to the police department which he gave me the address for and told me that I need to stay on the phone with him the entire time not to hang up and not to mute the call, I figured this must have been for security so they know I'm not trying to run or talk to someone for help to get out of it. So I did, I told him I was in the car and on the way. Before I left I texted my wife and told her what was happening and that I was going to the police department, she immediately was on her guard and told me she was going there as well. As I was driving there he told me to give him my ETA and also give him step by step information on my travels so I told him ""driving down this road, stopping at stop sign, turning right, etc."" About 5 minutes into the drive he told me that his lieutenant brought to his attention some paperwork I needed to read and to pull over somewhere safe and let him know when I was parked. I pulled over into a fire department parking lot and he sent me over an image that was an ""order for arrest"". He had me read it word for word (which re reading it now I don't think there was anything in it that they could use against me). Anyway reading through it out loud for the first time I read where it says that I am to be arrested and detained and that my bond has been set for $8,500. He asked if I understand what I read and I said I did. He then proceeded to tell me, that because there is an order for my arrest if I were to come to the police department they would be required to place me under arrest and detain me for 2-3 days until the proper paperwork could be processed. He then said that however if I were to bring in a ""bond stamp"" to the police station that they would not have to arrest me and I would not have an arrest on my permanent record. I would say this is where I started feeling slightly suspicious but still to scared to question anything until I knew for sure. My wife was almost to the police department at this point. I told him that I didn't have $8,500 and that I could try and ask family for the money, he said to give him a minute and then came back and said he got approval from their ""finance department"" for a partial payment on the bond for the time being which is when he asked me how much I could pay and I told him what I could pay and he left again for a second and came back and said that they would accept that partial payment. I asked if I should just go to the courthouse and purchase the bond there and he told me that's not how it works that you need to go to a ""money center"" to purchase a ""bond stamp"". He said that he would send me a document to present to the money center who would approve the bond stamps after the purchase and then I would bring the stamp to the police department and as long as I appeared in court on my court date the bond would be refunded. So he then directed me to go to Walmart money center and that's where I could purchase the bond. Now my spidey senses are really tingling. So I start heading to Walmart. At this point my wife is at the police station and she goes in to talk to someone, I send her all the documents this guy has sent me, give her his name and all the information I have via text. I pull into the Walmart parking lot and park and let him know. Now he sends me this barcode via text and says to show it to the money center employee and tell them I need to purchase a ""go to bond"" I think is what he called it for the amount I told them I could pay. Now my wife is in the police station and so I'm walking very slowly from the back of the parking lot into Walmart while I'm waiting to hear back from her what she finds out from the police department. I get inside and lie to the scammer and tell him there's a long line for the money center so it's going to be awhile. So I keep him on the phone and go look at yugioh cards like any grownup would while my wife talks to the sheriff and he pulls my name up and sees that there is no warrant out for my arrest, he confirms there's no officer by that name in the police department and tells me that the judge who signed for the arrest has been retired for over 10 years now. At this point everything I needed to know is confirmed so I ask ""officer are you still there"" he says yes and I proceed to inform him that my wife is at the sheriffs office right now and that judge _____ has been retired for over 10 years and asked him if he could explain why that is. He says ""well....that's the courts for you"" I then lose my cool a little bit and tell him to go fuck himself and then I tell him how he was really convincing and almost had me there and asked him how many people he gets with this out of my own curiosity and he just kind of mumbled a response I'm sure just totally off guard that he had been caught. I then told him to go find a church and again to go fuck himself....my brain was a little scattered... he then said chillingly ""well, I guess I'll move onto the next one."" and hung up. I did some sleuthing, added his phone number to my contacts and was able to get a ""friend suggestion"" via snapchat associated with his phone number which had his name on it. So I called the sheriff's office and gave them the phone number and the persons name that I had found. And that's the end of the story. Very embarrassed by this whole encounter, but gosh was it believable! Please everyone be on the watch out for this one and don't fall for it!",ukaiwenxiao message posted new submissions rscams please message new users beware posted start getting private messages saying professional hacker recovery expert lawyer help get money back small fee call recovery never take private always come form comments post open community keep eye take private reminder rules rscams contact information including last names phone numbers etc civil one another name calling insults personal army requests scammerscambaiting posts permitted uncensored gore personal photographs allowed without blurring full list rules available sidebar clicking help us reporting recovery rulebreaking content report button review reports also consider warning community members recovery see comments questions rules send us modmail clicking bot action performed automatically please contact questions concerns desertstorm extremely convincing told warrant arrest due missing jury duty told legal trouble shut hang police collect evidence babysit legal cases give handle btw always broken leg flip phone apps amazing many problems go away people pushing urgent matters hear kaiwenxiao yeahglad joy get knowing wasted hour time wasted hour mine seriousbig believe one around years decades australia actually post fine instead contacting us directly kaiwenxiao idea often watch guys youtube catch call center never heard one convincing southern swang around extremely convincing seriousbig many commenters ask dumb fall clever clever reading posts many seem fall longer read scams various small changes happening venerable takes one good fit catch us still vigilant share experiences hopefully sharing story help someone else rereminded udonemessedupaaron nothing believable first red flag wouldve police officer calling tell warrant arrest would show take jail warrant kaiwenxiao looking back agree defense naivety grew overseas interaction police months ago car stolen found entirely believable missed jury duty hadnt received mail multiple weeks including court information regarding car theft glad wife swoop save day dinx cop told illegally phone driving would first red flag kaiwenxiao hed use language sir able safely pull safe location park let send form professional time illegal talk phone driving state honestly didnt much seemed reasonable stay phone knew coming turn obviously complete bone head falling long time dinx glad made situation without losing much except time gas money mariss anyone calling asking money pressuring hang cousin bad place fell canada makes even less sense shes embarrassed best thing talk educate others kaiwenxiao wife hadnt available go police station check well may screwed saneless never give anything anyone calls money information benefit doubt research number legitimate site call always ohwahtagusiam spoof phone numbers number saved gave police might even real number kaiwenxiao possibly better send send ohwahtagusiam well yes probably would done case ditzen courier feel super scared forget cops take payments glad wife able actually help nice support times bold scammer ask much hi uditzen summoned explain courier courier fraud situations usually start phone call scammer may lots information impersonate bank employees police government officials say account linked fraud another crime request assistance youll asked either withdraw money purchase gift cards expensive items youll directed give money way one thing sets courier fraud phone scams often local connection victims may meet someone real life hand cash items bot action performed automatically please contact questions concerns kaiwenxiao apparently gullible thought hope sent barcode take walmart would figured fully cant say sure wife definitely saved butt one widespray law enforcement never call tell warrant arrest come rather show person serve warrant away go silver bracelets back squad car theres also finance departments police station deal negotiating folkss bonds whole thing staying phone going mute etc capitalize sense urgency also try prevent exactly didspeak others whod tell able determine glad didnt end losing money youll never fall type moving forward either obdami wow choicenewspaper future referenceshut f police want talk whole right remain silent applies well obligation speak police traffic issue years ago right could see people would get pissed half hour get call somebody acting buddy saying hey mike call back reverse searched number local police officer never returned call never heard another thing talked telling cops might tried talking police never helps especially fake police choicenewspaper cops call tell warrant arrest come arrest ass

ISSM Looking for advice ,NonceJ,SecurityCareerAdvice,3,1731014595.0,3,"Quick background: I have been an at this company as an ISSM for just over a year now. Did one year as an ISSO before starting here, and 10 years doing SA/NA type work. My boss works across the country and has limited insight at my location. I work with an FSO who tries to act as if he’s my boss. This has led to several communication issues between myself and leadership at the site. People constantly go to him for cybersecurity related issues assuming he is my manager. Recently the FSO asked me for a report, I said sure but what for, and he says it’s a meeting only for management. I manage a lot of projects and it’s a lot harder when I don’t have the information I need. I brought it up to him later and asked if it would be a good idea to get me involved in these types of meetings, he told me not to worry about it and it’s mostly programmatics. I guess I just feel like it’s hard to be a ISSM when you’re not treated like a manager. Wanted to see if anyone had input/advice on how to go about this. I’m also curious how much other ISSMs work with their FSOs, and if the dynamic is the same.",untrustedprocess org published org chart easy trace chain command dotted line relationships noncej yes shows report boss across country security protective services untrustedprocess take concerns include voicing concerns input locally examples causing negative business impacts

Door-to-door stolen iPhone scam??,bali217,Scams,4,1731048238.0,3,"A few weeks ago, just after dark, a man and his middle-schoolish looking son knocked on the door. I had seen them walking up as I was working in the front room. I kept the screen door locked, but opened the interior door. They explained the kid lost his iPhone at a local theme park, and that find my phone was tracking it to a house on our block, which they showed me on the iPad. They also said the thief had taken a selfie with it, and showed me the pic and asked if I knew this person (who was wearing a shirt from the theme park, so presumably an employee). I said no, sorry, we’re anti-social and don’t really know our neighbors, but good luck. And they moved on. Tonight, again, just after dark, a different man knocked on the door, saying he lost his phone at the same theme park and it was tracking to our house (and showed us with a very old iPhone). My husband was like “no, we haven’t been there and we don’t have your iPhone, my wife said you came here before and it’s still the same answer, sorry.” And the guy was like ‘wait no, I’ve never been here?!’ I was listening from the other room and heard this was a different guy with a British accent. So I stepped in, said he was the second person to come by saying this, we don’t have the phone, if he wants to return with police we’d comply if they wanted to come look or something. I feel like this is shady, but I’m not sure how or why they would have the same story? Like are they friends, and this is the story they practiced to see if people are home? (Which we obviously were both times, as our office is well-lit and right in the front of our house) Or is there a thieving theme park worker in my neighborhood?

"""Encryption at Rest"" for Javascript.",Accurate-Screen8774,AskNetsec,1,1731052609.0,0,"I'm working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encryption at rest"". the react-hook is described in more detail here (https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). im using it as a solution for state-management. id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated. im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api. i have a PR here (https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events. the password is something never stored (not in a DB or local storage) the user will have to put in themselves to be able to decrypt the data. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data. i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key. i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.",

Practice Images to load directly into Autopsy?,BlackflagsSFE,computerforensics,1,1731017574.0,0,"Hey guys. I was wondering if anyone knew where some test images or mock cases existed to load into Autopsy directly? I have been messing around with it, and don't have much experience with it. Most of my experience is AXIOM from college. I tried adding the python file for the .ad1 extension, but I was unsuccessful. If someone knows how exactly to add the extension to read .ad1 files in Autopsy, I would be GRATEFUL to be able to get it working. I have .e01 files from cases we did in school, however, something seems to always go wrong and it doesn't seem to parse the information correctly. The case I worked on that has the most information is the .ad1 file. I have read people talking about mounting the drive in FTK Imager and then loading it into Autopsy, but I am not at all sure how to do that, as we didn't delve into FTK too much. Anyways, if anyone can be of ANY help, I would appreciate it! Thanks so much! Edit: When I DO try to mount with FTK and process it into Autopsy, this is the error I get: https://imgur.com/a/nTPAd73",

Is this a Modeling Contract Scam?,canibwittlespoon,Scams,7,1731033271.0,29,"So I found an advertisement on our state’s credible, legit theater and entertainment/performance job posting website for this photoshoot. This company is claiming they have a contract with Christian Dior and are doing remote photoshoots, all you have to do is apply and send in a headshot and your age and what city/state you’re located in. So I did, and in 2 hours, they responded back and accepted me for the photo shoot. I mean, makes sense because the photoshoot is taking place from now until November 15th allegedly. This email seems decently convincing, minus some major grammar errors and punctuation mishaps. But being paid upfront at all is usually a dead giveaway… I’m almost confident this is a scam, but I need another set of eyes or two to help me determine the truth of the matter. They provided their website as well, which if anyone wants the link, I will gladly give it to them.

I want to tell you what we have been seeing increasingly.

You call that number, and they tell you they are so and so, an agent for the airline you called. If you ask them to change a flight, upgrade a seat, etc, they will quote you a price above what you would have paid the airline. You are giving the fraudsters your credit card information and they are charging you . They don't make the change, they then message the airline - and tell us they are you, and ask for the change. They always, with no exceptions, ask for whatever needs to be done for free. This can not be done, so many times your change is not processed, and the bad guys have your card information.

ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS ,NoBonus7710,forensics,0,1731000278.0,0,"I am seeking advice in regards to a high profile case involving a female who was located deceased in a “Clandestine Grave” with obvious characteristics of murder. The M.E. was given witness testimony and he was observed by detectives doing the autopsy. The body is photographed and marked but the report doesn’t match the photos. ◦ Her clothes are removed and photographed but are oddly clean to found in red clay dirt. These clothes were not even processed by Dept of Forensics ◦ There is severely swollen eye and bruising covering her face. Her body is covered in bruises and suspicious imprints on her face ◦ The ME said he couldn’t clip her fingernails bc they had been cut down to her nail beds. This was not done by the ME and there is no way she could have done that to herself ◦ The date of death was recorded to have happened 13 days before her body was recovered but she has minimal decomposition. ◦ A second autopsy performed found she could not have been deceased more than 1-3 days prior to being buried and 6 days was the absolute maximum amount of days ◦ The hole was 2’x3’x2’ and net body was in the fetal position with her back facing up. Her head was at the highest level and angled upward ◦ Wrapped in 2 sheets, Both tied at each end. These sheets were not sent for forensic testing ◦ She had been redressed but messily ◦ The rape kit was sent out but no one admitted to seeing the results. Her death was classified before those results even came back. After obtaining a copy of those results, there was blood located in all 3 cavities. ( The people who admittedly had her were convicted sex offenders and violent to say the least) ◦ Her toxicology results came back with disclaimers saying the results are not to be used for forensic purposes. The Dr had to sign a waiver saying her blood was grossly coagulated and the results would be wrong. The Dr signed that release. ◦ The witness statements ended up coming from the people that were with her & 5 years later, there has been ever changing stories. The ME was going off of information that ended up to not be true, at no fault of his own ◦ No one contacted the family regarding prescriptions she was taking, she was prescribed Wellbutrin ◦ This death was ruled an “Accidental Overdose” Meth & Morphine Toxicity Her body was exhumed this year and a second autopsy was performed. Unfortunately, because the death is classified accidental, there is nothing LE will do to investigate this case. Is there any advice or recommendations on how to ask the ME to revisit his findings??? There are a lot of parts to this case and we really do not want to come across to the ME as accusatory or disrespectful. Please, any help would be appreciated. Just want to note, we have received all official autopsy photos",

To top it off he had a ton of remote access software installed that I had to go through and delete (like 5 programs????). But the thing that skeeves me out the most about this ""next web solutions"" is that I can't find a THING about it online. Nobody is talking about it at all and there's no sign of websites or anything pertaining to it.

Anyways was playing Fallout 76 when a message from a random popped up. Not uncommon in that game so I checked it. But it was so obviously a scam. Generic comment about them seeing my gamer score and saying I had a high one so my account was valuable. First red flag- no mention of what I actually play. And ain't no one paying for a 76 account so they obviously hadn't seen me in game. Sketchy web address link they wanted me to go to. Ugh. Instagram account they wanted me to hit up if I had any questions. Yeah right, like that's gonna happen. Was so obviously a scam I just laughed it off and deleted it. Funnily enough I have had legit people try and buy my account on PlayStation since I have.... way too many thousands of hours into an MMO over there- they just wanted my guild hall since they knew I'd stopped playing when I switched consoles.",ufluffwit message posted new submissions rscams please message new users beware posted start getting private messages saying professional hacker recovery expert lawyer help get money back small fee call recovery never take private always come form comments post open community keep eye take private reminder rules rscams contact information including last names phone numbers etc civil one another name calling insults personal army requests scammerscambaiting posts permitted uncensored gore personal photographs allowed without blurring full list rules available sidebar clicking help us reporting recovery rulebreaking content report button review reports also consider warning community members recovery see comments questions rules send us modmail clicking bot action performed automatically please contact questions concerns

Door to door vacuum salesman left the vacuum in my house?,SweeterPie,Scams,894,1730918735.0,287,"Earlier some guy knocked on my door offering to demo a carpet cleaning with a Kirby vacuum, I let him in to do it and after he vacuumed the carpet for a little while, about an hour, he didn’t actually clean the carpet and left the machine at my place. He had a little badge on his shirt that said “join the Kirby team” or something like that. He unboxed it to show it was new, but the machine was obviously dirty/previously used while he was taking it out and putting it together, I don’t know what significance it being new had? His “cleaning solution” was a bubbly liquid inside of a water bottle. He vacuumed for a bit and cleaned one window. While he was doing his sales pitch, I expressed if we were to purchase it, it would definitely need to be financed because we don’t have the funds for an upfront purchase like that, it seemed to push him away a bit and he wanted to leave it here and come back later to finish the cleaning. I insisted he should take it with him but he was even more persistent on leaving it and coming back later to finish the job. He said he would come back later when the man was home to do the actual cleaning demo (I know. Bad move letting him know he wasn’t here.) he left no information, no card, no company name, a white van pulled up and he got inside and left. It was a normal sales pitch experience in the beginning but by the end I felt verrrry uneasy. I didn’t sign anything, I didn’t agree to buy anything, I’m just confused and pretty concerned after the experience. I put it all out on the front porch for him to come collect later and I’m deciding I’m not gonna answer the door again. Edit#1:I have called non emergency just in case to let them know what happened. They said they will have an officer contact me. Edit #2: Sheriff called me, I told him what happened and he asked if I wanted anything done as of right now, nothing has happened yet so I told them I just wanted to make sure they were aware because if they come back and cause a fuss I’ll definitely need assistance from law enforcement. Edit #3: UPDATE, it’s dark out now but the same guy came back and picked it up, didn’t knock on the door or anything, then walked to the curb and sat down, looks like he’s waiting for a ride. I feel bad, but I guess the message was clear enough that we weren’t interested and he was respectful of that and decided not to pester about it. Will update if anything else comes of it, but this looks like it for now. Day after edit: I watched the clip with sound on this morning (didn’t while I was at work) after he picked it up and packed it all back in the box he left a farewell message: “sorry you guys can’t afford it have a nice night godbless”.

NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO ASK BUT: Unknown IP Used for Suspicious Login,Dayshinez,VPN,1,1731007081.0,2,"Hi everyone! Today, my grandpa asked me to check his Microsoft account because he received a notification about a password change (see the first picture). I decided to investigate by checking the IP address associated with this change to see if it matched his usual login location. It didn’t. Since he only uses his email on his laptop, it’s highly unlikely this login was his—especially as the IP location was in a very public place. He managed to reset his password (see the second picture) after some effort, which was fortunate. I’m not exactly an expert in IP tracking (or anything of the sort), and I’ve only recently started looking into this kind of issue, so I’m unsure if my concerns are completely justified. But I am worried: How could someone have accessed his account and changed the password? Could his data have been leaked? And are his other assets potentially at risk? Here’s what I’ve done so far to protect his account: 1. Changed his password. 2. Enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) for all logins. 3. Added my email as a backup recovery option in addition to his phone number. Can anyone advise on additional steps to ensure any of his other sensitive credentials and information is safe? Thanks in advance for any guidance.",trappedinvr used password email combination anywhere else change fust login attempt changing password turning fa fixed happened also ukrainian ips twice day changed password turned fa stopped probably bots checking leaked email addresses passwords trying sign check account valid see ihavebeenpwned email ever leaked

How to explain to my son the resell scam,24kdgolden,Scams,542,1730926960.0,104,"My son saw a user on TikTok who will ""teach"" him how to resell high ticket items like airpods, colognes, Burberry purses, etc. So my son paid XQRESELL to learn these secrets and then was referred to a ""vendor"" where he purchased airpods for $20 to resell for $150. The airpods are supposedly in transit. I asked my son why would a vendor sell him airpods for $20 so he could resell for $150 when the vendor could just skip the middleman and sell them for $150 himself? I told him I was skeptical if the airpods would even arrive and if they did come, they would be fake. It seems clear to me that this is a scam but how can I explain it better to my son? Maybe just wait for the airpods to never show it for knockoffs to arrive?",ukdgolden message posted new submissions rscams please message new users beware posted start getting private messages saying

Extracted quite a bit of juicy info from your system. and I've seen it all. Y eah, Y eah, I've got footage of you doing embarrassing things in your room (nice setup, by the way). I then developed videos and screenshots where on one side of the screen, there's the videos you had been enjoying, and on the other half, its your vacant face. With just a click, I can send this video to all of your contacts. I feel your worry and confusion. Honestly, I'm ready to wipe the slate clean, and let you continue with your daily life and wipe your slate clean. I am going to offer you two alternatives. First Alternative is to ignore my email message. Let me tell you what is going to happen if you take this option. I will send your video to your entire contacts. The video is straight fire, and I can't even fathom the embarrasement you'll face when your colleagues, friends, and fam see it. But hey, that's life, ain't it? Don't be playing the victim here. Other option is to pay me, and be confidential about it. We’ll call it my “privacy tip” . Now Lets discuss what will happen when you opt this choice. Y our secret will remain private. I'll wipe everything clean once you come through with the payment. Y ou'll make the payment via Bitcoin only. Pay attention, I'm telling you straight: 'We gotta make a deal' . I want you to know I'm coming at you with good intentions. I am a man of my words. Amount to be sent: $2000 BITCOIN ADDRESS IS: bc1qxdmpdj2hj3y76kxwggc0tr7t35cngmc7kjfpml Once you pay up, you'll sleep like a baby. I keep my word. Note: Y ou got one day to sort this out and I will only accept Bitcoins (I've a unique pixel in this e mail, and now I know that you've read this email message). My system will catch that Bitcoin payment and wipe out all the dirt I got on you. Don't even think about replying to this or negotiating, it's pointless. The email and wallet are custom-made for you, untraceable. If I suspect that you've shared or discussed this email with someone else, the video will instantly start getting sent to your contacts. And don't even think about turning off your phone or resetting it to factory settings. It's pointless. I don't make mistakes, V eronica. Honestly, those online tips about covering your camera aren't as useless as they seem. I am waiting for my pPayment...

Typical Sextortion,Consistent_Run2751,Sextortion,5,1730980501.0,3,"Been a lonely single guy (23) for a while now after college, I fell for the usual dating app, onto instagram, then a you know what video. 5 minutes into the video call they immediately sent me a list of my instagram contacts and said they were going to leak it. I trust that all of my friends on instagram don't care about it and I have no family on social media so I'm not too concerned there. I'm more concerned about what they could do with that video since it has my face in it. Is it possible for them to falsely accuse me or send it onto the overall wide internet? I made a really stupid move in the moment of the blocking everything then DELETING all the chats. I later found this thread and realized I shouldn't have deleted the chats and I should've instead taking screen shots of everything. Will I still be fine? All I have is a screen shot of her threatening me and saying ""So you want to fight huh"" ""Okay I'll show you no mercy"". I feel like a complete idiot falling for this cause I usually ward it off and see it coming, but I guess I was just really down bad this time and fell for it. It was so obvious as well, broken english, no personal details, weird times of contact. I feel so stupid. I blocked them and reported them immediately then sought help from the internet as usual. I first found the FBI post and did everything that was said there like NCII and the Internet crimes report. I don't have much info about the girl who did it other than their dating profile and their social media profile names. I've gone completely missing on the internet basically, all social media deactivated or completely privated with max private settings. Anything with my real name has been changed and the little social media I was already using deleted. All my friends are notified there's a scammer using my likeness. Family won't ever find out since they don't use social media in the first place. So basically I'm not too concerned about my nudes being shared, tbh the bros would laugh their asses off. Is there anything else I should do or have I done everything I can do at this point and should just wait it out? I'm mostly concerned if they will try to use it for anything else. Swearing off dating apps now, sticking with the good old fashioned real life interactions.",increase email scams stating users hacked asking money ignore email says youve hacked personal information email might contain likely data breach bot action performed automatically please contact questions concerns please read post new victims please read first warningbeware recovery likely contacted recovery scammer parasites try convince hack scammer remove files devices please report comments report button hidden option receive dm please take screenshot forward mod team stay safe bot action performed automatically please contact questions concerns worthleadership sounds clear opinion used personal number id change also hit one week mark contact pretty clear always unlikely share photos benefit

I think I’m generally pretty good at picking out a scam but I’m struggling to decide if this is one or not. It’s a site selling a smart baby monitor - as a general rule I’d have thought it was legit, the product has reviews on YouTube, but there are a bunch of spelling mistakes on the website. It was only created/founded in 2023. Would anyone be willing to take a look and let me know their thoughts on if this is a legitimate site / product? It seems like a very sophisticated scam if so but it’s a lot of money to spend so I want to make sure. Sorry if this is dumb and I know it’s not the typical content on here but when trying to assess the site I thought of the other redditors here and that there seems to be plenty of expertise.

I saw one of those stupid ads on Reddit for those crappy mobile games, this one called Age of Origins, and it had some big fat monster walking around in the video. I tapped on the video because I thought it looked funny and I was thinking of posting it somewhere referencing the 'Gary Barlow's massive son' meme that's doing the rounds right now. I tapped on the video once, backed out of it, opened it again, and instantly got security alerts on my banking app to ask if I'd just made a transaction with my card. In total, it tried to charge me five times, for a total of $410. The transactions all reference Facebook - I don't have any payment data linked to my Facebook account, nor my Reddit account, so I have no idea how this has pulled through.

How to automate security policies auditing?,Krlier,AskNetsec,6,1730989844.0,6,"Hi guys, Recently my company has put together a document with all the security requirements that applications must meet to be considered ""mature"" and compliant to the company's risk appetite. The main issue is that all applications (way too many to do this process manually) should be evaluated to provide a clearer view of the security maturity. With this scenario in mind, how can I automate the process of validating each and every application for the security policy? As an example, some of the points include the use of authentication best practices, rate limiting, secure data transmission and others. I know that there are some projects, such OWASP's ASVS, that theoretically could be verified automatically. At least level 1. Has any one done that?

"""I Zelled you money by mistake and please send it back"" but it's true! And there are twists",BingBongDingDong222,Scams,444,1730926117.0,98,"An attorney mistakenly Zelled money to the wrong person, where it was 1 number off from her husband, who she intended to send it to. The mistaken recipient, who could be a reader of r/scams immediately called his bank's fraud department to let them know. The fraud department told him that they would handle it and not to send the money back, because that's the scam. The attorney pestered the person she sent it to demanding the money back, in the same way that scammers to. But this time it was for real. According to the ethics complaint, Baker sent electronic communications Sept. 22, 2023, that allegedly included: • A text to Illinois Reynolds, telling him that his retention of the money is “unlawful,” and if he did not return the money in 24 hours, “collection, garnishment and all available recovery methods will commence, including notifying your employer of your conduct.” • Another text threatening to sue Illinois Reynolds, informing him that he is a “thief,” threatening to tell a charity affiliated with Reynolds that he committed a “theft,” and saying she should share the information with “anyone with a basic internet connection.” • Yet another text telling Illinois Reynolds that he and his wife were being named in a civil action for unjust enrichment. The text included an address thought to be his “in an effort to intimidate” him and his wife, according to the complaint. • An email threatening a suit to Illinois Reynolds’ wife, a third grade teacher, using her school email address. She even ended up suing the dude!

Please contact my office while you still have an opportunity to do so” She leaves a case number at the end of the voicemail with her extension number I used to live with my grandmother about 3 years ago and I’m guessing that is the address they have on file for me, my grandmother has said someone has shown up asking for me and she has been receiving these calls as well. My question is should I be worried? Is this an actual legal matter I should be worried about? Or a scam? They are not saying exactly what it is for and I have not called the number back. I do not want people showing up to my grand mothers home or harassing her with calls It might be a debt collector for old credit cards I had at the beginning of Covid, that is what I’m thinking it could possibly be But if this was an actual legal matter wouldn’t they be able to find me with my current address since it’s on my valid drivers license????? I have also checked my county website and I do not see any active or open cases associated with me for any debt collectors suing or etc…. Should I call them back and get more info or ignore it????

How to keep safe my google account safe from session token/cookies theft,Full-Career5382,cybersecurity_help,6,1730951965.0,9,"In alot of subreddits I've been seeing people getting hacked even though they have security measures in place like 2FA, Antivirus, password managers, pass keys and they avoid suspicious downloads. This has caused my anxiety so much that I've been scared to even use chrome and especially since recently I found out my phone will no longer be getting updates. Even though most cases I've seen on reddit involve PCs which I don't have I know it can still happen on mobile devices. I have multiple questions and I probably ask for more in the replies. First of all how does it happen especially to google accounts? Is it a rare occurrence? Can the websites I use do this or does it need to be websites that I have accounts on? Is My google account always in danger since chrome always uses it? How can I stay safe from stuff like this even after setting up like this especially phone that recently stopped getting updates? And lastly should I take break from looking at subbed like these? Thank you Note: for those who want know my security measures .I have turned on enhanced protection,send do not track requests,and https only in chrome settings .I have the app version of adguard that I downloaded off the site .I turned off the SMS version of 2FA and instead use google prompt which I believe I asked about in a another subreddit although not as strong as authentication app it is sufficient .I checked all the websites I use in virustotal and the worst that I got was 1/96 suspicious for 2 sites that use adult content(I don't know if I can say the names) .I recently moved all my passwords too Bitwarden .My info has not been found by Haveibeenpwned or Google's dark browsing .I have don't have a large social media presence .My Bitdefender free trial is coming to a end and I've already downloaded Malwarebyte .I have no banking info on this phone and only use it for reddit,youtube,and adult content The only things I don't have is a VPN and 2FA on all of my accounts though none of them are really important to me and I have hundreds if tabs open in chrome and almost half them lead to one of those websites and while I want to stop using that site I still want to find a

How much should we study for a topic when preparing for a FAANG interview?,waltfrombb,cybersecurity,3,1731016899.0,7,"POSITION: Security Engineer! I have about 4 years of full-time experience in the field. I'm studying relevant (to the job description I applied for) domains/topics from https://github.com/gracenolan/Notes . Somebody on Reddit said that for each of the topics under the domain you are studying, you should know enough info on it to speak for at least 5 minutes. This is obviously a lot and I don't have that much time. I have an hour-long FAANG phone interview coming up in several days (I've had a little over 2 weeks to prepare in total, and I've been looking over things outside of this as well), so it's been stressful. I'm not sure if my note taking is enough or if I should dive in deeper. For example, for the 'interception attacks' topic under Network attacks (under the Exploits domain), I just wrote down what a man-in-the-middle attack is and very brief descriptions of 2-3 other attacks that would fall under it.

I tried to change my password for all the accounts I’ve used on my computer. However, two weeks later, same thing happened again, I checked the log in location, there was nothing odd. After that I ran Windows AV full scan multiple times and came up with 3 malicious signs: 1. There was one .cpl file in my User\temp folder. 2. trojan:script/wacatac h!ml 3. They also put a script to assign something to my Registry Key Then I checked, removed all, changed all passwords again. Downloaded Bitdefenders Premium, Kaspersky Antivirus, Hitman Pro to do full scan came back nothing, then I used Secure Erase+ on my bios to delete all partitions on my ssd, installed new Windows from USB. Could someone reassure me or at least let me know if what I did was enough? anyone knows what info they could have got from what I mentioned?

Background in software development and currently working network security. Studied for about 6 months for at least an hour a day but went about it the wrong way in the beginning. I attempted to read the OSG but it’s so boring, so I bought the audiobook which I got through 50% of until I realized it was going in one ear and out the other. Turned to destination certification mind maps which imo are the best resource out there and a great place to start. I used learnZap had about 1500 questions in and a readiness of 77% but really think this tool is better suited for learning concepts, it didn’t really mirror the questions on the exam at all for me. I also tried Quantum tests and did about 400 questions there, they are overly tricky in my opinion but written in the closest style to the exam, DON’T let your confidence waiver after taking these tests. I was steady getting 50-60% right and thought I was going to bomb the exam. During the exam I felt great after the first 20 or so questions then they got insanely harder and that confidence went straight down. Used my instincts and picked the best answer I thought fit the question. The “think like a manager” approach really was over emphasized in my opinion or I was just given a more technical exam. Don’t think you can just think like a manager and pass, you have to know your concepts and you have to know at least minor details if not intermediate level understanding. That being said I do think you have to be able to look at a few good options and pick the best or most well suited.

Sextortion I got tricked in is still Haunting me to This day,Shdow_Gamer_451,Sextortion,8,1730962048.0,3,"When I was 19, I got tricked by an online person to do sexual things. I flashed myself on camera, which turns out, was a scammer the whole time. My entire family saw me panic as I didn't know what to do. The whole time, my little brother saw me get tricked by this and ever since, he used it as a valid weapon to defend himself when I call him out. Lately, my little brother has been missing so much school, the school might treat him as a disabled kid. When I ask about it, he gets angry and said I was an idiot who flashed my dick in front of another man, which brings back this horrible experience. I may be 21 now, but that still haunts me because of him. The most frustrating thing about everything is that my mom and my sister thinks my little brother missing a ton of school and him getting offended is the same level as me getting tricked to flash my dick and have it recorded on video. I don't know what to do anymore at this point as it will never truly leave me alone. My little brother brings it up when he gets ""triggered"" when called out, my mom and my sister bring it up to force me to sympathize with him when he does have a melt down.
