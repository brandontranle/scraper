People are not suggesting help desk because the skills in help desk are needed for your career. They’re suggesting it because it’s the job you can get. You should be looking for all opportunities in IT, you absolutely need work experience. Let’s say you do get help desk, great. Next steps probably still are something better, like sysadmin, network admin, etc. but people go from help desk to cyber sometimes and sometimes need 2-3 more IT jobs before they make it over. My advice is to quit worrying so much about your dream job and just get a job. The rest will come.

Which one should i choose to make a better resume ( side by side i am doing other courses and upskilling) My take: Individual coursework listed in a resume doesn't significantly impact your employability on-paper (vs. a work history or the addition of sections like ""Skills"" or ""Projects""). In fact, on /r/EngineeringResumes, I generally advocate against listing your coursework unless you have nothing more impactful that could use that pagespace instead. As such, I wouldn't let that influence the courses you enroll in. Have you audited the respective classes? What have those efforts shown? We only have the titles of the classes to go off of. Where do these classes fit into your broader formal education? For example, is there another class that might overlap with one or the other?

Through a collaboration between Google’s Project Zero and DeepMind, the ""Big Sleep"" AI agent identified a memory safety flaw in SQLite, a popular database engine. This achievement is a milestone in cybersecurity, leveraging artificial intelligence for enhanced protection. The groundbreaking find underscores the power of AI when combined with skilled ethical hackers. Google’s Project Zero, known for hunting down critical vulnerabilities, and DeepMind's AI expertise are setting new standards with this large language model-driven agent. Big Sleep is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in preemptive security measures. Traditionally, fuzzing (injecting random data to uncover bugs) has been a key tool, but it has limitations. Big Sleep aims to overcome these by detecting complex vulnerabilities before software even reaches users. This could pave the way for AI to become an integral part of software testing, catching issues traditional methods miss. Although still experimental, Google’s Big Sleep points to a promising future. As AI tools evolve, they could streamline vulnerability management, making it faster and more cost-effective. With innovations like these, defenders may finally stay one step ahead in the cybersecurity race. I've kept saying this is going to happen and now Google has actually done it, programmed Al to discover zero-day vulnerabilities. This should be a warning because malicious security hackers will also be looking for 0-day vulnerabilities this way and a celebration because Al will help in finding those vulnerabilities. It creates a lot of questions for the future.

[Author: No-Pattern8701, Score: 13, Posted: 1730778506.0] TLDR at end My director has taught our team quite a bit, and one of the key pieces he's discussed with us lately is the business decision with risk. We had some moderate losses on some accounts. The frequency of this occuring vs the overall fraud activity was fairly low, but the loss amount per account was fairly high. When discussing possible solutions he made sure to highlight the cost-benefit from a business perspective. It's not word for word, but basically: ""Look we tell them we need X product work to make the solution to completely fix this issue. As much as our team would like that, since by nature our org is focused on maximizing security, at the end of the day the business may determine that the losses incurred from this aren't worth the product work - and that's okay. That's just a business decision."" As far as if this is a skill someone entry level can grow into, I definitely think so - with the right leadership/mentoring, working with other groups, and time. Each person on our team has a quasi-area of specialization and projects we're working on. These projects are often mitigation solutions which require product work and intersect with product teams and other areas such as legal, customer service, etc. By working on these projects with other lines of business, if you keep an open mind you start to grow more perspective on what those groups prioritize, how they communicate, etc. You start to get a feel for how the business as a whole operates and see why things happen a given way. Things you may have said ""I don't get why we don't just implement Y solution?"" to when you had just started often begin to make a bit more sense when you see more of the moving pieces. Whether you agree with whatever it is or not can still vary, but you can understand why it occurs at least. TLDR I think an entry level person can learn these skills with a combination of: - Good mentorship/leadership. - Working with other business units. - Genuine effort to understand those other groups. - Unpacking why certain decisions occur, especially as they happen. - A healthy amount of critical thinking, awareness, and attempting to remain as unbiased as possible.

User Trust: Being hacked can severely damage user trust. Users expect websites to be secure, and a breach can lead to loss of business and credibility. Recovery: If a website is hacked, recovery can be complex and costly. Restoring functionality and security can take significantly longer than planned updates. Control: Taking a site offline for updates allows for planned maintenance and communication with users, whereas a hack often leaves little control over the situation. Long-term Impact: Regular updates can improve functionality, performance, and security, leading to a better overall experience for users.

Firstly - technical/ security It sounds like your company has a ""Banned Country"" or ""High Risk"" country list. Your IT Team checked that where you were going is not on that list and said, from a technical standpoint, travel is ok. Your CyberSecurity should be using the same list to drive alerts. Chances are they KNOW you are there, see no traffic from other places, and deduce you were working from there. Again, since it isn't banned then no harm, no foul. From a BUSINESS side, things get more complex. Your IT Team/ CyberSec team will probably have no clue/ not care about them. You working in another country for a prolonged period of time may/ will have Tax implications. You are likely visiting that country under a ""tourist visa"" but you are clearly ""working"". There could be contractual obligations that prevent you working on ""Project X"" or ""Customer Y"" from a country other than your home residence. I have seen this written into contracts before.

Security policy will be: A. Have controls in place to block connections to VPN from foreign IP's, B. Alert when this happens and refer investigation over to HR/ETHICS/whatever-team-handles-this-for-your-company Etc. SCENARIO 2. Company does not have such a policy, but Security has a policy to monitor for foreign connections as they don't have a foreign work force, so this might imply compromise/attack. Security will STILL alert for this kind of behavior, but they will only investigate far enough to make sure it's a company asset and this is expected behavior (I.e. you told them you were going to x country). Security does NOT CARE WHAT YOUR BOSS WANTS. If your boss says something different from Company Policy, your security team is not going to probably even notify your boss.

I am hesitant to say there are likely to be many Fortune 500 companies that don't at least have some kind of hybrid internal and outsourced model. And on the flip side, if a company has like 50 endpoints there is almost no way they are ever going to pay someone internal to do actual cybersecurity. There is usually going to be some poor single IT guy who is expected to handle that kind of stuff when it pops up at a company that size, or they just get an MDR solution if the execs are security minded for some reason.

I’d love to get practical advice and hear about your experiences on several specific aspects. Here are some questions I have in mind: 1. Adapting Zero Trust to Existing Infrastructures: I’ve read that implementing ZTS without disrupting ongoing operations can be challenging, especially in organizations with established infrastructures. What are some of the primary challenges you faced when integrating Zero Trust with an existing infrastructure? Are there specific phases or key steps you’d recommend to make this transition smoother? 2. Managing Permissions and Segmentation: Micro-segmentation is often highlighted as a core aspect of ZTS. What are some best practices for segmenting networks and setting access policies without creating management complexity? Have you found effective ways to balance security and ease of administration? 3. Mitigating Lateral Movement Risks: One of the goals of Zero Trust is to minimize the risk of lateral movement by potential attackers. What strategies or tools have you found most effective in detecting and preventing lateral movement within a Zero Trust framework? 4. Applying Zero Trust in Cloud Environments: Many companies now operate in multi-cloud or hybrid environments, which complicates policy enforcement. How have you handled the challenges of enforcing Zero Trust policies consistently across different cloud providers? Are there tools you’d recommend for orchestrating policies across hybrid environments? 5. Measuring the Effectiveness of a Zero Trust Strategy: As we implement ZTS, I want to ensure we’re setting the right metrics to assess its effectiveness. What metrics have you found most useful in evaluating the success of Zero Trust within your organization? How do you measure improvements in security posture over time? 6. Balancing Security with User Experience: Zero Trust often requires continuous authentication and verification, which can impact the user experience. How do you balance strong security protocols with minimizing friction for users? Have you had success with adaptive authentication or behavioral analysis to streamline access? 7. Budget and ROI Considerations: The costs associated with implementing ZTS—tools, training, and restructuring—can be significant. What are some approaches you’ve taken to quantify the ROI of Zero Trust, or to justify these investments to leadership? Any insights, tools, or resources you’d recommend would be greatly appreciated!

The issue is the following: We mostly receive a firmware ""blob"" from suppliers, for which we then can do CVE scans on our side (e.g. via Cybellum, JFrog XRay, ...). Unfortunately, those scanners mostly do version matching and in consequence deliver a large amount of false-positives. Why false-positives? Of course the suppliers perform backporting, so applying security patches of newer versions on to older versions of an application/library. This is exactly what e.g. Debian does, and what also some CVE scanners can recognize (but just based on version matching and an available backport list afaik). But in our case, we don't get a qualitative and trustful enough list of applied backports, so we are still stuck with false-positives. For us security guys this gets pretty time-consuming and frustrating to manually verify and filter out false-positives. Now I'm wondering if there are others (also from other sectors) out there which face similar issues and somehow solved it? Or are there more out there who face the same issue like us?

You can’t just inject SS7 messages from your phone. The air interface doesn’t support those messages (ergo needing to rent access). Yes, SS7 is an outdated protocol that lacks innate authN/authZ, and it’s very much abusable, but it’s a darned sight easier to abuse email for example.

So if your operator does nothing to protect their subscribers from SS7 attacks then yes all an attacker with access to the network would need is a phone number to do a wide range of attacks. SS7 has 3 rough categories of messages you can use to discuss cyber security. Category 1 messages are those that should only ever be generated by a subscriber when they're on their home network. So your operator can easily block these messages they receive over the roaming network. You can do this on a STP easily enough so you don't even need much of an investment to protect your subscribers. Category 2 messages are those received from other networks for when their subscribers are on your network. These are harder to block, but all you need to check is if the message is for one of your subscribers and if it is, then you block it. This really needs a firewall or purpose built inspection device but you can do some stuff with existing signalling equipment. Category 3 messages are those received from other networks for when your subscribers are on their network. This is difficult to block because you need to check whether the subscriber could legitimately have started roaming on their network or not. So you really need a firewall that can make those velocity checks. For example, you need to check if someone could realistically move straight from Germany to China. Actual take up of these protections is a lot lower than it should be. It requires investing in the network and a good understanding of the threats and even though there are a lot of resources available, it's just not a priority for a lot of operators. Also, to carry out an attack you need to both understand the SS7 protocol to a reasonable degree and have access to a global title from an operator that your operator has an international roaming agreement with. That's not simple to arrange but also isn't particularly difficult. If operators policed their global titles a lot better, a lot of the attacks on SS7 would also go away.
