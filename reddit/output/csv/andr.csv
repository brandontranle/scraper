I have a few questions out of curiosity. I read your post on Medium, and I‚Äôve been hunting for over a year as well. I‚Äôve found a few vulnerabilities, but they either turned out to be duplicates or informational. Did you discover this vulnerability in a VDP program, and was it related to a new feature in that program?  [Author: coolhaxor, Score: 1, Posted: 1730947778.0] Excellent work brother.
