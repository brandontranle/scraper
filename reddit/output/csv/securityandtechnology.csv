What I find is this really digs into my library playing tracks I don't ordinarily listen to or may be inadequately tagged or maybe are just part of an album that's a completely different style, so I really get to hear all of my music Additionally, and perhaps less importantly to me, these features allow it to do a really good job transitioning between tracks with fades and overlays [Author: Mental_Tea_4084, Score: 2, Posted: 1731021942.0] Very cool, thanks for the description.

TL;DR, you probably won't be done tagging by the time you need to change discs. [Author: michaelkrieger, Score: 1, Posted: 1731041515.0] Secure ripping does take time. If you want error correction ripping in “burst mode” you can do it at 52x. If you want secure ripping you’re usually less than 1x or only a few times depending on settings.

There are some 60k individual tracks, a lot of them are old indie bands from when I ran a licensed, internet radio station in the pre-Napster era when music online was either non existent, or very scattered. I really enjoyed that. I don't do a lot of driving, mainly into town to pick up any goods I need on the farm. I do stream them around the house tho, on random. One minute you will hear a classical piece, maybe a concerto, and the next minute you'll be listening to death metal. There are only a small handful of sub genres that just don't resonate with me. I could not conceive of a world devoid of music and am highly suspicious of people who do not listen to music on a regular basis.

Thought it might be helpful for you. Apparently, the dev was inspired by another app called Wasted by x13a, which could factory reset a device under duress using triggers like a special password or USB connection. While that’s great, factory resets can be obvious and risky if the person holding your device realizes what's going on. This app takes it up a notch by discreetly wiping data within a specific user profile, then uninstalling or hiding itself so it leaves as few traces as possible. You can set it up to wipe data if a duress password is entered on the lock screen, if a USB device connects without approval, or after repeated failed password attempts. There are some other features available: disabling logs to hide apps actions, disabling safe boot mode and running TRIM after data destruction. App has versions disguised as other apps to make detection of it traces in system harder. Looks interesting for me, though I'm not sure to what extent renaming package will protect against finding traces of app activity on device.

It's about the fact no company, not even amazon and google, have the budget or talent pool to cover all the things they need to do. So instead, the goal is to treat security like SRE and reduce the toil (non productive button clicking work) and focus entirely on engineering efforts that scale with the company. Automation and platform engineering are a big part of that, but it's not less security; it's doing security in a way that scales like delivering a product or service to internal/external customers. Second the niche jobs are more about where you are and how you're applying a skillset. For example exploit development and research is like 90% AppSec focusing on fuzzing, software analysis, etc. The exact same skills as doing DevSecOps at a serious level. Just being applied differently. So my best suggestion would be to hit SRE and DevSecOps and AppSec methodologies hard and get a very strong foundation.
