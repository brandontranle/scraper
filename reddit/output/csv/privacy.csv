Just say that this goes against our rights to privacy, and may even be unconstitutional, and ask them to please vote against this law. Points I suggest including in the email: I agree with the need to prevent and combat child sexual abuse. I am concerned that the proposed rules imply constant surveillance of personal communications, such as messages and emails, using Artificial Intelligence directly on the device. I believe that this mass monitoring constitutes a violation of the right to privacy, which is guaranteed by the Constitution. The mandatory identification through ID cards may increase users' vulnerability to cyberattacks and data breaches. The use of AI to monitor communications could result in false positives, unjustly exposing private conversations of innocent people. I fear that real criminals will find ways to circumvent the surveillance, making these measures ineffective against those who should truly be caught. Meanwhile, innocent people, who do not try to evade these measures, may be unjustly exposed due to false positives. I urge the need to find a balance between protecting children and preserving citizens' fundamental rights. -- Remember... politicians will be exempt from this control. It's easy to create laws for the common people, but as long as they don't affect those who make the laws, everything's fine, right?...

I’m looking for an email service with unlimited aliases. I tried to figure this out around 5 years ago, but ended up not finding anything. I settled on making several different gmail accounts… one for personal contacts, one for social media accounts, one for shopping accounts, one for banking accounts, etc. Obviously gmail is not the best for privacy but my main goal was for hackers not to be able to get to all my accounts if something got compromised. For example, if my shopping gmail account gets hacked, at least my banking gmail account is still safe. Now I want to take it a step further and try to achieve my original goal. Ideally I’d have one email address that I never share with anyone, and I’d have an unlimited amount of aliases that I can use for each service. These aliases should last forever and never be reused if I cancel the service. This way, everything is in one place and I can quickly and easily see if something is compromised. Based on my research, I’m leaning toward getting a custom domain. It seems like every other option has drawbacks or doesn’t achieve what I want 100%. Am I missing any downsides to getting a custom domain for my email? Also, if I went that route, where would I host it and how would I make the unlimited aliases for it? To be clear, as much as I’m concerned about privacy, I’m more concerned about privacy from each service I sign up for. I’m not as concerned about privacy from my email provider. If that makes sense. If I can achieve both, great… but my main focus is being able to use an alias to hide my email from each service. I’m thinking about Start Mail with a custom domain. Can anyone recommend this? My concerns are: they don’t have an app which would be inconvenient. Also if Start Mail ever goes out of business, I’m guessing I’ll still have my main custom domain email… but where would all my aliases go? This is going to be a huge project.

One form of election fraud was voting as someone you expected wouldn’t be showing up to vote, perhaps they are dead or had moved away. But neighbors would know. So if the late Jane Smith had voted, individuals would be able to report the fraud. Registration rolls are inevitability going to have lots of ineligible people listed through no malice. Dead people, people who’ve moved away, and non-citizens who accident,y checked the wrong box. Registration rolls are designed to err in that direction. Exceedingly few ineligible voters try to vote. That is particularly true of the dead ones, but it applies to the others as well. But historically a common form of fraud was to have other people vote under those names. Making the list of who has voted is part of the system to balance the nature of registration roles. A major source of this voting fraud was done by political parties at polling stations. The people who ran the polling stations could submit lots of ballots under the names of no-shows. The mid 20th century joke that Democrats in Chicago were so loyal to the party that they continued to vote for it long after they were dead had real truth to it. Trump calling Republicans election officials in Georgia in 2020 to “find me 11,000 votes” was a throwback to when that kind of thing really happened.

Of course, that was back in the day when ""community"" meant a group of people living with an interconnected social life. And the political parties both aimed to support the democratic ideal. We knew our neighbors and felt that we were all in it together. Today ""community"" means a special interest group: The artist community, the gay community, the privacy community. For people with no sense of actual community, even their community affilliations may be private information. I might not want you to know that I'm in the Coke community and you might not want me to know that you're in the Pepsl community -- simply because while we might be neighbors, we have no relationship and thus no mutual trust. That's a relatively new thing. We've embarked on a path of radical individualism in a modern society where people don't necessarily need to deal with each other logistically. Even romance and marriage have been reduced to business deals. I recently read that there's a trend of young women on dates to demand that their date pays for dinner. Not because the man is expected to support the woman. Rather, because they want credit for the expense and labor involved in making themselves up for the date. Sex roles recast as equal labor. :) I once read that in Massachusetts during colonial days, it was illegal to live alone. That was considered ""the devil's playground"", bad for the community. If a man was found to be living alone, he would be given 6 weeks to move in with a family or be assigned one. It was a radically different view of individualism, privacy and social duty.

You can add some DNS to it. Proxies too (I don't get into that for work) maybe disable JavaScript as well. Heard that is useful too. Also, Edge works faster on Windows11, because it is opened when you start windows 11. Most apps use Edge in the backend. Cause it's a PWA app (progressive web application) which basically means it's a webpage, but without the browser stuff. So apps like Outlook, CoPilot, reddit, Tiktok are mostly PWAs.

Yeah, that's ok. Everyone should know right information. So, basically when you create a account in suppose protonmail, you created a whole proton account. After this, if you install proton vpn or proton pass then you see a option ""login with proton"" in login page. That means, the account you created is not for only mail but also for all proton products. I realised it when I was going to take their paid plan. Like their ""Mail Plus"" plan which offer 15GB of Proton Drive, 5 medium speed vpn location along with Protonmail. So, what you think how you can access the other services? You have to enter same login credentials you used while creating your protonmail account in proton's app in order to use the facilities. Ok, that's may look normal but what about SimpleLogin, it is not developed under Proton, it is acquired by Proton later still you can see the ""Login with Proton"" option. So all the things are internally integrated with each other. Secondly, as a user do you want to use all the app from same organisation? May be yes for normal user but for a privacy focused user, the answer is always no. Because, it anything wrong happen then you have to face problems for all services (password manager, vpn, cloud, mail, note, calendar). Are we the only two who know that? No, many people consider it. Then why the company is acquiring other services. Although, the organisation call themselves nonprofit organisation then how they can acquire other services? In mobile Proton require Google play system for push notification. Wow! A google alternative require google services for push notification although they have plan to remove it in rheir future update (which will not happen in near future). Also, they share metadata to google. In past, Proton handover user data to Swiss government wven it's end to end encrypted. I don't have much knowledge about it. Tuta mail also faced same type of issue but still they fight for it and no one ever mentioned that incident. But for Proton, we still mention the incident while considering privacy first. Lastly, Proton is not bad, their target audience is beginner level user of privacy, who recently decide to come out from google and don't know much about privacy. You think it by yourself, you are using services where your some kind of data from mail (anything like metadata) will be linked with your vpn profile, password manager, cloud storage and calendar, do you want it?

[Author: Digital-Chupacabra, Score: 3, Posted: 1730823720.0] Please share your thoughts on why privacy matters when it comes to music preferences. Music is deeply personal, it can express your political, sexual, religious beliefs. This is data that isn't always as easy to get though other means. Is this information an advertiser and the government need to know? What about your friends? Your parents? Your employer? Future employers? etc. It's out there and it's easy to find. Then there is the other data that can be gleaned from your use of a streaming service, where you live, who your friends are, when you are awake, when you are driving, where you work out, when you work out, how long you work out, when you are asleep, wouldn't be hard to figure out when people are having sex, and MUCH MUCH more. And that is before we combine it with all the other data out there on you. What if you listen racist neo-nazi music and your boss finds out? What if you listen to LGBTA+ music and your conservative religious family finds out? And again this is before we add in, podcasts, audio books, purchases of music or merch, etc. etc. I was asking why some people prefer not to share their music preferences with the company to get a good service Does giving them all this information make the product better? It would be really hard to argue that it does, look at Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, they all struggle with suggesting relevant content. YouTube is a prime example of this, it's easy with a few videos to get the algorithm to start suggesting just that kind of content. What if I like both classical music and heavy metal? Fuck me I guess, I traded all this data that has demonstrable value and all I got was a worse experience. Why this information is valuable? It's valuable because billion dollar companies have been founded upon hoarding it an leasing access to it to others to sell you crap, or surveil you. The value proposition is I give a huge company that is making tons of money my data, they use it to make more money and in return I get what? a shittier experience? locked into their ecosystem? the right to lease music I have no control over? a tiny tiny fraction of what I pay will go to the company who owns the rights to the music who will then pay the artist a tiny fraction of that money? I can do all of that for already without these platforms, and without giving them my data and all but the last for free. my pre-coffee answer to just the first bit Selfhosted is really the only way to go.

You see an ad for that chocolate you ordered last time you felt lonely. It's not just a list of songs you listen to, it's an index to your emotions. Bundled up with other information it can be a very powerful tool to target you when you're most vulnerable. "

That'll tank FF's marketshare, and gives Google way more control over web standards, thus hurting everyone's privacy far more.

FHE has a massive performance impact, and the LLM space is *super* sensitive to performance. With the TEE properly set up, you can directly encrypt your prompt from your browser in such a way that the only way to read it is to be an NVIDIA chip with certain properties. On the other side, the service provider can run the inference, attach a receipt that says nothing shady happened, and re-encrypt it such that only you, the user can read it. Yes, TEEs can be cracked open, but it is getting more and more expensive to do that as the hardware security gets better, and in general it precludes any above-board service provider from doing it. Not perfect, but it's a feature coming to all of the next generation NVIDIA chips, and it's way better than the status quo where running inference on someone else's machine automatically gives them full access to your prompt. This feature will likely be hard to implement, and I'd bet many of the big providers just aren't going to do it, but hopefully some do, and there is enough market demand for privacy to force everyone to switch over (doubtful). Once the service provider has it set up though, there's basically no downsides, unlike FHE which is going to be rough.

Phone number and physical address pose the biggest problems. You can’t exactly have one-off versions of those like with email.

Photos and videos are much larger than documents. And the bigger something is, the more expensive it is to store. Deleting photos sends a message to Google that they no longer have your permission to store them. I am not a lawyer, but I assume if Google gets caught storing things without people's consent, there's a chance they will actually be punished for this. That's why you should seize the opportunity to revoke that consent. Even if there is a TOS loophole that allows Google to store your data, TOS does not supersede law.

I'm not trying to be UNhelpful here by saying that if you really want to know, you're going to have to read their privacy policy/any type of AUP published by each. WhatsApp is owned by facebook, assume it's a mess and even if it appeared clean could still not be trusted ever for anything. WhatsApp is also not open source Telegram would always have that allure of extra features possibly pulling you into public servers, exchanging your privacy for convenience. Of the three you listed, by far Signal. You do have to provide a phone number to sign-up, but they did introduce usernames which you can assign and share post sign-up in lieu of your phone number. They do not collect or share your phone number or name or usage data with third parties or marketers. Some folks below mention Session, which I do believe I read actually makes an effort to obscure metadata (but I don't know anything about it or how they attempt to do so); Signal does not do this and the it would be clear to anyone having a full view of your network traffic like your ISP or law enforcement with a warrant investigating you, and access to the pipes between you and whoever you're talking to, that you are sharing messages with another Signal user at so and so IP address, and the relative size of the messages (wouldn't be difficult to tell if images or videos were shared based on the size). Still, this is going to be a concern for a very small subset of folks in a country like the United States where the application and it's technology are completely legal. Some countries this is not the case, and you're not putting off the I'm a criminal and need to hide from ""x"" vibe lol.. but again, they would definitely be able to see that data was passing between you and your friends IP addresses; but it is all encrypted so it does not tell you much. Unlike say RCS text messaging, the encryption key guaranteeing the privacy of your written communications is stored only on your device and not on any signal servers; so you can feel confident that your messages are indeed 100% private. There is also a feature to verify your friends/contacts encryption key and mark it as so, so you know you are talking to that persons device with absolute certainty. Signal does offer a feature to relay your voice and video calls through a signal server for privacy (not exposing your ip address to the other user), and firewall related issues at the expense of lower bit rates. The hardest part about communicating ""privately"", or ""securely"" is getting other people to adopt the communication method. Unless you have a high risk use case specifically, both telegram encrypted messaging (not groups/unencrypted messaging) and signal will keep your messages from being read and accessed only by the intended recipient, but Signal is the clear winner without a doubt for these three for other reasons I went into and more. Signal is fantastic, and I highly recommend it as THE sole communications app one uses on mobile (again, for regular joes/99.99% of folks).

This data is accessible real-time. Telegram from the other hand stores your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used and history of username changes. Beside metadata, Telegram store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up and to properly display names in notifications.

So, the more appropriate comparison should be with X/Facebook/Discord etc. End2end encryption (except for DMs) is impossible on platforms with billions of users. The reason is, in a group, each message must be individually sent to all members, i.e., if you have 100,000 users, your single message must be sent to each user, i.e. 99,999 times. The same is true with responses and interactions. There is no amount of bandwidth that can handle that. This is why Signal limits groups to 1000 members only. Second, regarding Signal's metadata: here is my personal experience which includes a statement from Signal: In March 2024, I set up Molly (FOSS version of Signal) and picked up a user name. Two days later, I deleted my account and forgot about it. I haven't made a single call or chat. 5 months later, in August, I set up Molly again, this time with a different phone number. To my surprise, as soon as I logged in, I was presented with a prompt asking me if I wanted to keep my user name (the one I picked in March). I immediately deleted my account. Here is what I've found on further research. Signal considers deleted account as unregistered, which means it is deleted from your phone, but NOT FROM THEIR SERVERS. Further, Signal states that data on their servers is kept for a 'fixed' period of time. If a user wants to delete it sooner, they must contact Signal's data protection officers and request deletion. Here is the exact quote from Signal from their official community website: Delete account unregisters you from the service and deletes all data locally. Service data is persisted for a fixed amount of time for unregistered accounts. If you want to delete your data from the service sooner you can contact our data protection officer by emailing privacy@signal.org Edit: Certainly, their 'fixed' period of time is longer than 5 months.

As for how you go about it, do NOT delete your old emails. Migrate a few services at a time, starting with those you deem most important. It's a process and will take time. Why you don't delete your old emails is because you are bound to forget some service that you might have wanted to keep. It's also recommended you use a password manager and email aliases for your different accounts for security reasons.

You'll find TONS of things that you really don't want to give your information out (spam email #2). The professional work email, yes my company gives me a work email, but in interviews/work background checks/things I want to send from work email to myself to save/etc I provide use one (#3) The everyday stuff (email #4). To OP: DON'T think that by creating a new email you are gaining privacy. Data harvesting is at a place where it is going to figure out that these new emails correlate to your old ones - all it takes is logging in from the same machine/MAC address that you previously used on that old email and you're linked. However, it is a good idea to create them from a security stand point. When you were younger, you probably had a lax security policy on yourself, this creates a new barrier after you've migrated over.

I had a few old email addresses and wanted to only have one. So, I would recommend email aliasing, which is great, since it allows you to create an unlimited number of aliases (with Proton Premium at least) that are all forwarded to 1 or more email addresses (dependent on how you set it up). Basically, an alias is like a disguise for your real email. I decided that I wanted each account to have its own alias (like facebook.word@domain.com). In the event that one of your aliases is leaked, it is no big deal, as you can just create another. The situation would not be quite the same if you only had one email. Next, I bought a domain, since that is a little safer in the event that SimpleLogin (the email aliasing provider) is down or closes. I then began the struggle of updating all my accounts, which I already had in a password manager, with the new aliases. Both storing of password and handling of email aliases can be done with Proton Pass. It is also a great opportunity to reconsider if you really need all your accounts, I deleted more than 50. And if some site doesn't allow you to change your email, you can try to contact their support and say that you would like to exercise your right to rectification under the GDPR regulation, it might work. TLDR: I recommend that you begin using email aliasing with your own domain. [Author: gleep23, Score: 2, Posted: 1730532619.0] I agree with using aliases. Outlook (free) offers 15+ aliases at once, and you can delete old ones, add new ones. ProtonMail (paid) comes with 5 aliases initially (you can add more cheaply, package deals), and it has heaps of privacy features. ProtonMail offers a free tier which is good as any of the other web mail services (Gmail, Outlook) but its layout is more professional, with more privacy and security features.

Then you can have unique email addresses for every account, which can be redirected to the mailbox of your choice. Great for security. Great for cutting down spam. Great for separating social emails from online accounts, business/work accounts, etc. You can just update the email addresses for existing accounts over time, e.g. if/when you next use them. It only takes about 15 seconds to create a new email address (SimpleLogin has an auto generate browser plug-in) and to update your personal info in the site. Easy peasy.

The best practice is to create a unique email for every single website/service. One of the biggest risks to your online privacy are data breaches. The reason they’re a risk is because most people use 1 email for every single website, so as soon as someone gets that email they know every other service you use (which have also appeared in data breaches or are publicly indexed). Along with this, the best practice would be to also have a separate VOIP phone number every time you have to give up a phone number, but at the very least you should have a separate Google voice number. That way your real phone number isn’t associated with any online services, and is only given out to friends or used when you can’t use VOIP.
